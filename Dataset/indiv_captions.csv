His sister Anika won a green hippo for him at a Village Inn crane machine during his first hospital stay, and she gave it to him then. Today, she brought it back to him. 
This time was one hundred percent different from last time, with the notable exception that it still scared the hell out of me.

Crazy how fast things happened. One week you‚Äôre like ‚Äòyeah it‚Äôs just a flu, who cares‚Äô and then it hits you. It‚Äôs a lot more. The freedom you got used to is suddenly gone, and worrying becomes a daily pastime.
So now, everyday I count my blessings. I have love, security and health.
Do the same and stay healthy everyone. Let‚Äôs ride this one out together, with compassion and understanding. This is not the time to hate or judge. Help each other, be kind. There are many who have it worse. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, l‚Äôm proud of my growing belly and I show it off in tight dresses. Plus, I have a lovely man (and many friends) that tell me how beautiful I look daily. Yet I look in envy at those pregnant girls rightfully showing off their gorgeous bodies online with so much confidence. While when I pass a mirror, my eyes will still firstly judge those softening areas that have nothing to do with growing a baby and everything with the cookies I‚Äôm stuffing down my face.
So, to turn this around, to look at this body with just the pride it deserves, and to create an ever lasting memory of this incredible, special and beautiful time in the lives of myself and @surfguidealgarve , I asked the grande @massimopardiniphotography to document it and make me feel pretty.

Why did you go away?
All our time together still feels like yesterday
I never thought I'd see 
A single day without you,
The things we take for granted, 
We can sometimes lose
And if I promise not to feel this pain,
Will I see you again? Will I see you again?
'Cause time will pass me by,
Maybe I'll never learn to smile,
But I know I'll make it through,
If you wait for me
And all the tears I cry,
No matter how I try,
They'll never bring you home to me
Won't you wait for me in heaven?

On some level we'd been preparing for this for a while--she'd been diagnosed with kidney failure a little over a year ago--but these final few days, when things took a sudden turn, were still so shocking and unexpected. I'm thankful she's no longer struggling, and that I was with her in the last moments, scratching her cheek and head in the way only I knew how.

Over this last decade, she was truly MY kitty. When I worked overseas for a while I left her with my folks for about three months. The first morning I was back she immediately jumped into my lap and snuggled up against me, something my parents said had never happened in her time there. Beth can attest to the numerous times Enid would yowl with loneliness when I was gone, but would completely ignore her when Beth would call ""hey, I'm right here!"" There was only one person she truly wanted, and I'm glad I got to feel her soft fur one last time this morning.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

I'd be lying if I said it wasn't without its challenges, but those were few and far between. I'll truly miss my favorite little human being around all the time but I'm so proud of the little lady she has become. We finished up this evening by making a board showing a few of the fun moments we had these last 2+ months.

So we told her she ""might"" (wink, wink) get a new bike for her birthday if she learned to ride the smaller bike. Well, ladies and gentlemen, she worked and worked and learned to ride that tiny bike and on her birthday she received a new bike and loves it (especially the fact that it has pegs because she's a huge Napoleon Dynamite fan).

A week after we returned home our workplace doors closed for non-emergency access, and we started working from home shortly after that. I had a terrible cold for a month.

Leading all the way without killing off the French, Ireland found themselves down with one play left. The rest is history.

""We know the effort that went in and how special that kick from Johnny was. We tried to ensure that magic moments like that don't go without the reward and the reward was this afternoon with that win."" That play came down to ""steel and commitment"" added Schmidt when invited to nominate a standout moment.

‚ÄúI was touring playing music for a living in the past and would always look for new local craft beer to try. From that it quickly turned into finding new wines. Natural wine wasn‚Äôt a thing I was aware of at the time until a few of my older friends caught onto this little bar in Los Feliz - Bar Covell. It was the first time I had wine with varietals I was familiar with done in a totally different style. The wines were fresh and bright, acid driven and slightly funky. 

A few restaurants and cocktail bars later, I began working at a natural wine bar where my mind was blown by everything we carried. Grower producer champagne, old skin-contact wine from Georgia, hybrid grapes from the northeast and everything beyond.

5884,"Isolation Project: Self Portrait

For our second isolation project we were tasked with taking a self portrait. 
In the portrait we should include something that has been with us in isolation or that represents our isolation. 
I chose emotion. 
Our emotions are always with us and I‚Äôve taken the time during isolation to try and really understand my emotional state and acknowledge it. 
What you see is a story, starting with silliness flowing to boredom, depression and anger. 
Then follows acceptance and a will to take charge of an emotional state. Which then evolves to seeking support from those around you, leading to light and happiness. 
I‚Äôve included the before images and the final edited images. 
To make the edits I used Affinity Photo for iPad. 
In the images I used a darker colour palate for the ‚Äúnegative‚Äù emotions, which get gradually darker and grainier as they progress. 
As the emotional state moves into a more positive mental state the images get lighter, brighter and the light becomes more intense. 
All photos where taken using an iPhone 11 Pro Max using the wide lens, the iPhone was on a tripod using a remote shutter and the light is provided by a large window for ambient light and an additional adjustable key light. 
For the record I think it‚Äôs important to not think of less desired emotions as ‚Äúnegative‚Äù. While they can feel that way at the time it‚Äôs important to see that without them we would never feel happiness. We all have dark times, it‚Äôs good to acknowledge and accept them and to deal with them.

Kids came to the main worship service instead of going to their class. The Pastor invited the kids to come down during the Gospel procession. He explained to them what was going to happen and why. Then they got to witness the procession up close. It was really special, and taught me and my family things about the Anglican traditions that I didn‚Äôt know yet.

Rumor has it he's the worst kind of heartbreaker, but as much as Gracie tries to keep her distance, she is inexplicably drawn to him. ‚ù§Ô∏è Noah puts aside his bad boy ways when he and Gracie start dating, and she feels on top of the world - or at least on top of college life at UT Knoxville.

I've been watching them interact more closely lately. In part, because they actually interact.

It's been a rough road of jealousy between them growing up. Finley gets treated differently by my ex husband for being ""normal"". Jasmine got special, unwanted, attention from me for being so sick growing up. Guilt, gender, age, circumstance....caused me to parent them very differently. And they are both growing up with a profoundly handicapped brother who requires 24/7 attention that causes a ripple in everything.

I am proud of them for sticking it through all the crap. They are really starting to bond and it is beautiful. When they see each other now, they enjoy each other. Finally, laughter is erupting. Hugs are being returned. Goofiness takes place. I love yous are exchanged.

The blessings come in the time gifted to us with no appointments and no buildings we can enter. We have spent so many hours out exploring our area. State parks, new lakes, farm areas, Amish Country, Sonic happy hours, Chipotl√© to go and so much more. The hours we have spent out in nature this summer are priceless.

First time developing color film at home using the newly received Lab-box from their kickstarter 2 years ago. Colors came out great.  Fool-proof film loading in daylight but I was beyond a fool and wasted 2 rolls due to user error. Overall happy with the result.

6927,"After the ho‚Äôike at Nahiku Hawaiian Church I headed off towards Hana, intending to drive through the Kaupo side to get back to the valley. Stopped off at Hana for a bit to check out their Festivals of Aloha, which was taking place this weekend. Parked near my favorite promontory overlooking Hana Bay, walked over to the edge of the cliff to take in the view. There were three local boys there, pensively looking out towards the ocean and approaching rain squall, about the age of the boy who died earlier last week. After looking quietly out a bit, I turned and said to them, ‚ÄúHey guys, so sorry to hear about Jre.‚Äù Jredyn Kaina was a high school freshman, who succumbed on Tuesday to injuries from a serious crash in his ATV the weekend before. One of them said, ‚ÄúYeah uncle‚Ä¶ so sad.‚Äù And after a pause, ‚ÄúHow you heard about it, uncle?‚Äù seeing as I clearly wasn‚Äôt from Hana.

I related to them how I was part of the officiating crew at the MIL Girls Volleyball tournament semifinal on Thursday evening at Seabury Hall, between their Hana High School girls varsity team versus Moloka‚Äôi. And that onlookers had posters of Jre emblazoned with ‚ÄúPlay for Jre, Tyra-Li!‚Äù and other such sentiments. And that after the game, which Hana won, instead of celebratory cheers the girls‚Äîfrom both teams‚Äîburst out in tears, crying and sobbing in long, tight hugs with family and friends.

Someone‚Äôs death is always a sad thing but when it happens to one‚Äôs teenage peer‚Äîand a beloved aunty or uncle‚Äôs son or sibling‚Äîis particularly hard to bear. It was evident at Erdman Gym that evening, applying a thick veneer of tragedy to what should have been an upbeat, competitive scene.

I told the boys how it was such a strange and painful flashback for me. Shared with them how, in 2014, the year my hanai son Pono was a senior in high school, the week before his Kamehameha Schools varsity boys volleyball team was to play in the season tournament, a player from Hana HS, senior Isaiah Pu-Akima died when his car went over a guardrail on Hana Highway, plunging hundreds of feet down to the ocean. The boys nodded sadly, saying they remembered what happened with Isaiah as well.

I didn‚Äôt think I could enjoy Harpreet and Jason‚Äôs food more, but I was quite mistaken. As he gave me my usual combo plate of palak paneer, organic chicken curry, lemon rice and naan, Jason asked if I wanted some cumin hot sauce with it and, as I hadn‚Äôt had this sauce before, I said sure. (These enterprising young chefs have gone just beyond purveying food from their truck and expanded into sauce creation, with their Chutney Swamy Foods collection. Currently, they have three: Tamarind Sauce, Sweet Mango Sauce‚Äîboth of which I have, and this new Cumin Hot Sauce.) I dotted each item in the combo plate with a couple drops of the cumin sauce and, after but a couple of bites sat there in the crimson shade totally flabbergasted. It was an incredible, absurd revelation.

Already bursting with flavors both subtle and arch, the cumin hot sauce allowed each ingredient of the combo plate to express something else‚Ä¶ something intense and forthright, something‚Ä¶ whatever the opposite of banal is. Even the zesty lemon rice tasted new somehow, its citrus essence playfully manifesting like some sort of multi-armed Hindu deity. Can you tell I was in food nirvana? ::chuckle:: After savoring and swallowing a couple more bites of the meal, I peremptorily slammed shut the to-go plate and hastened back to the truck, demanding of Jason to sell me a whole bottle, quick. (I grabbed one each of the other 2 sauces, as I know these‚Äôll make great Christmas presents for a couple of discerning eaters I know. ::chuckle::) It took cosmic restraint on my part not to grace my Haleakala smoothie with a couple of sauce dots just to see if the drink would also‚Ä¶ evolve. LOL. As I left, I bade Harpreet aloha (Jason had gone off with a shopping cart of what looked like recyclables) and raved to her: ‚Äú‚Ä¶you know what that sauce will be good in?

It is difficult to reconcile such tempered beauty with the chaos that is to come. There will be the empty spaces where some of us will seek our last refuge but even those, I expect, will be tainted by our hands, our intemperate stewardship of all that was good. Our only home.

It‚Äôs not easy to gauge the depth and texture of things when they‚Äôre in such stark contrast, like this. That ragged curve there is a massive volcano, on whose flanks lie the dreams of some, the histories of many.

Dusk beguiles, as always. Don‚Äôt do it, she pleaded‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt cross that road before our flimsy barriers go up. It was as if we could hear them in the dark, their instincts pulling them from the sea to the pond inshore, but before that, this highway.

Once upon a time, my mother and I joined with a group of devoted honu protectors; naturalists, all, even though we came from different walks of life. It would be before dawn, or even shortly after midnight. We‚Äôd stand with kerosene lamps or flashlights, cordoning off North Kihei Road as it passes along Ma‚Äôalaea Beach, asking motorists kindly to wait‚Äîor take the longer route home‚Äîso as to not disturb the migration of egg-laying turtles.

It worked for a while, for a few years. And then, the human outcry overweening, a fence was erected instead, to prevent the turtles from their slow crawl inland. For now, it is to be this way and this way only and always, as long as we walk on our two legs and lead with our brains. Who are they, anyway, these inferior species, to dictate what we should or should not do?

But nature has a way of reclaiming itself, in its own time. Before long, the ocean will rise and cover this road, which will melt under the eonic onslaught of waves, wind, water. Sand will accrue, here as elsewhere and, should they endure our stifling presence, the honu will return, to cross once again from death to life.

(There will be time aplenty to ponder, perhaps to grieve; and, of course, to find again and somehow the joy in what once was.) Once upon a time, my father found himself thrust on the precipice-edge of a mortal dilemma: to deny what he saw with his very own eyes, lest he never see his family again. He chose, painfully‚Ä¶ but, in the hindsight of decades later, wisely. He would see things like the mirror image of cloud and sky on the surface of a blissed-out pond perched rather unlikely upon the shoulders of a hill, just like this. He thought he never would.

That said, the (necessary) anger and rage is still there‚Ä¶ just‚Ä¶ beneath the surface of things. (The woman holding my sign is Julia, and her dog is Miley.

(Last night I called Pono on O‚Äôahu to suggest that he and his cousins spend part of the weekend stocking up on water and other supplies, in the event Hector escalates to a 4 or even 5 by the time it appears in our ambit sometime early next week.) The view from here, glimpsed from this low lavarock parapet, asserts that the ocean is innocent‚Äîfor now; but that it could emerge from its quiet‚Ä¶ entirely heedless of our animal angsts and, as it has always done, manifest its sway over all our affairs, without time, and beyond it. Past this vista, then, a disquieting, still-invisible, storm. There is much to be disturbed about the prevailing human predicament‚ÄîI suppose this is as it always has been. But the fraying climate worries me the most, as it speaks in gestures far beyond any of our collective will to prevent, mitigate.

I feel in this scene a dangerous* scrim in the existential play of climate change; it is a drama playing itself out all over the planet right now, and the analyses and prognoses by those in the know is grim.

9 de julho - O dia que se comemora a Revolu√ß√£o Constitucionalista de 1932. üìç

O Mausol√©u aos Her√≥is de 32 localizado no Parque do Ibiraquera em S√£o Paulo, √© o local de descanso dos soldados tombados na Revolu√ß√£o de 1932. 
Obra do escultor italiano e ex-combatente Galileo Ugo Emendabili o obelisco √© feito em puro m√°rmore travertino. Sob o obelisco, um mausol√©u em formato de cruz que abriga os restos mortais dos combatentes com acesso diante ao parque. üéñ
.
Obelisco √© o maior monumento da cidade de S√£o Paulo com 72 metros de altura e 1932 metros quadrados - n√∫mero relacionado ao ano da revolu√ß√£o. 
Poemas e frases do escritor Guilherme de Almeida se espalham pelo local, como na fachada, que ostenta os dizeres ""viveram pouco para morrer bem, morreram jovens para viver sempre"". üèÖ

Namast√™. 

√â o que est√° escrito no capacho da minha nova vizinha de frente. 
N√£o me orgulho (mas na verdade me orgulho) de tudo que extrapolei sobre uma pessoa analisando sua escolha de capacho. 

Logo na primeira semana o aroma de incenso emanou de seu apartamento, n√£o tenho certeza, mas acho que o odor espec√≠fico era de ‚Äúeu sabia‚Äù. 

Nunca entrei em seu apartamento para confirmar que cristais, m√≥veis r√∫sticos e possivelmente pir√¢mides sem d√∫vida comp√µem a decora√ß√£o. 

Desde que come√ßou o confinamento a querida viZENha passou a deixar seus cal√ßados sobre o capacho namast√™. 

√Ås vezes √© um t√™nis daqueles de quem queria fazer trilha. Que tem sola ideal para enfrentar toda a terra que nunca vai encontrar. 

Outras um par de chinelos. Do casamento de Martha e Bernardo em seis de julho de 2013. N√£o sei o que ela comprou de presente para Martha e Bernardo mas tenho certeza que ela os desejou muita luz.

Finalmente juntos. Quem diria?

Quem sabe algu√©m de fora que n√£o conhecesse a hist√≥ria do casal poderia achar que um nasceu para o outro. 

Mas a verdade √© que mal podiam se encostar. Fisicamente mesmo, n√£o dava. Era insuport√°vel. Quanto mais tentassem maior a chance de um virar a cara pro outro. 

Pra transformar essa situa√ß√£o n√£o foi preciso um jantar chique num bistr√¥ da moda ou chef badalado. Foi um salgado de estufa de bar. Daqueles que nos perguntamos se √© de verdade ou s√≥ para display. 

Era de verdade. Bastaram alguns dias de sofrimento e ap√≥s todo aquele tempo finalmente ficaram juntos. O bot√£o da cal√ßa finalmente se encaixou a casa daquela cal√ßa apertada. Enfim juntos. 

Quanto vai durar √© dif√≠cil de saber. Mas quem sabe esse novo amor seja um incentivo para finalmente entrar em forma.

 ‚ÄúUm romance inesperado entre velhos conhecidos‚Äú",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
7892,"05/07/2020

Ano passado eu e minha mulher decidimos que havia chegado o momento. Ter√≠amos um cachorro. Mais especificamente, um Corgi. 

Corgis n√£o s√£o uma ra√ßa t√£o conhecida, a maioria os conhece como ‚Äúo cachorro da rainha‚Äù. Ainda que ele seja nosso. 

√â natural. A ra√ßa n√£o √© t√£o comum no Brasil. Por isso me surpreendi num dos primeiros passeios quando um outro dono de cachorro me perguntou:

- √â o Biggy?

Por um momento achei que a pessoa tinha falado ‚ÄúZiggy‚Äù, nome do meu c√£o. Mas n√£o tinha como. Ele me explicou que Biggy era outro Corgi, j√° estabelecido na vizinhan√ßa. Pura coincid√™ncia. 

Mais alguns passeios e mais um humano pergunta:

- √â o Biggy?
- N√£o. Esse √© o Ziggy. 
- Nossa. Parece muito o Biggy. 

Duvido. 

As confus√µes continuaram. Diminu√≠ram mas se seguiam. Achei que o Ziggy j√° estava conquistando seu espa√ßo. N√£o precisa de muito. Ele tem as patas curtas. 

Meu limite chegou ao fim quando um carro parou no meio da rua e seu motorista gritou de dentro do carro:

- √â o Biggy?

Mudamos para o bairro do cachorro mais popular da Terra! Todos conhecem o Biggy. Se quiser ele vira prefeito. 

J√° acostumado, ap√≥s algumas semanas vejo um cachorro de longe. Meu c√£o adora cachorros, todos, quando avista j√° se joga no ch√£o para que n√£o saiamos do lugar at√© que ele chegue. 

Ao se aproximar percebi que era um Corgi. Perguntei para seu humano qual o nome e ele respondeu:

- √â o Biggy. E o seu, √© o Ziggy?

Desculpa o mau jeito mas faz tempo que n√£o recebo ningu√©m. 

To pra pintar as paredes faz uma vida. 
Est√£o cheias de arranh√£o e promessas n√£o cumpridas.

Acho que as coisas ser√£o melhores daqui pra frente.

Come√ßa no contato visual. 
N√£o se sabe exatamente como, mas o pedido de permiss√£o e respectivo consentimento s√£o emitidos entre piscares de olhos. 

Os p√©s aceleram a aproxima√ß√£o, esticando o passo em dire√ß√£o ao outro corpo. 

Ainda de olhos ligados chega a hora de preparar os bra√ßos. As vezes tudo ocorre como se fosse ensaiado, outras um pouco mais atrapalhado. 

Bra√ßos j√° levantados, o direito um pouco mais alto que o esquerdo. 
A abertura e velocidade est√£o diretamente proporcionais a saudade. 

Sendo o fechamento de bra√ßos bem sucedido os corpos se encontram completamente colados. 

Os peitorais juntos, sincronizando respira√ß√£o e batimento card√≠aco. 

Os rostos opostos, a pior parte do abra√ßo, n√£o se consegue assistir o ato, h√° de se compensar com os outros sentidos. 

Ali, colado na nuca se sente o cheiro do outro, a temperatura, a rigidez de seus m√∫sculos em suas m√£os. 

O tapinha nas costa √© opcional. 

Para o grande final resta o movimento de desencaixe. 

Gentilmente √© dado um passo atr√°s, para retomar o contato visual. Momento cr√≠tico. Uma m√° execu√ß√£o pode arruinar tudo. 

√â nesse √∫ltimo contato visual onde se certifica que tudo foi feito com vontade, carinho e um pouco de vulnerabilidade. 

√â o reconhecimento m√∫tuo da felicidade de se ter experienciado toda a m√°gica que acabou de acontecer.

D√∫vidas s√£o muito melhores que certezas. 

Certezas geram fanatismo, engano, vergonha. 
D√∫vidas geram pesquisa, ajuda, coopera√ß√£o. 

N√£o sei se √© impress√£o minha mas parece que √© muito mais bonito e aceit√°vel ter certezas do que d√∫vidas. E eu discordo. 

Eu entendo que certezas passam seguran√ßa e d√∫vidas o contr√°rio, mas essa seguran√ßa toda n√£o √© uma ilus√£o?

Porque se pararmos pra pensar, n√≥s humanos, somos p√©ssimos em nossas certezas. 

Nossos sentimentos, opini√µes, costumes mudam o tempo todo. At√© na ci√™ncia onde buscam encontrar as grandes constantes do Universo vivem achando novas ‚Äúverdades‚Äù. 

J√° a d√∫vida pode cair mal em nossos ouvidos mas n√£o temos como negar que nada √© mais honesto que uma d√∫vida. Quantas mentiras podem lhe deixar mais bem visto substituindo um ‚Äúeu n√£o sei‚Äù. 

A d√∫vida gera pesquisa, coopera√ß√£o ajuda. Ela est√° mais pr√≥xima da certeza do que a maioria das certezas, fixas, cegas, surdas, imut√°veis.

Valorizemos as d√∫vidas, incentivemos, abracemos a liberta√ß√£o do ‚ÄúEu n√£o sei‚Äù. Assim, meio que por acidente, quem sabe sejamos mais s√°bios. N√£o tenho certeza, mas acho que √© uma boa ideia.

A √∫ltima vez que sai sem m√°scara foi pra encontrar velhos amigos. 

Daqueles que em algum momento participaram de quase todo minuto da sua vida, mas por casa dela mesma, uma hora deixaram de fazer parte. N√£o teve drama, n√£o teve briga, s√≥ uma sequ√™ncia fatal de ‚Äúvamos combinar‚Äù. 

O interessante desse tipo de amizade √© que o reencontro parece reatar uma conversa que foi largada na metade. No meio de uma frase nos despedimos. Agora continuamos. 15 anos depois.

Ao mesmo tempo esses amigo claramente  n√£o s√£o os mesmos. S√£o como personagens de um sonho. Fulano est√° igualzinho a vida real. S√≥ que um de seus bra√ßos √© um carrinho de m√£o. 

Voc√™ faz o seu melhor para n√£o olhar diretamente para o membro superior de seu amigo nem gritar ‚ÄúCACETE, SEU BRA√áO √â UM CARRINHO DE M√ÉO!‚Äù
No melhor cen√°rio ele finge que n√£o percebeu e voc√™ que n√£o viu. 

O carrinho de m√£o pode se manifestar de outras maneiras. Pode ser uma mesinha lateral no lugar de uma perna. Ou um mini cofre eletr√¥nico no lugar de uma m√£o. 

O tamanho n√£o importa tanto, o que importa √© que algo n√£o encaixa no seu velho amigo e n√£o necessariamente voc√™ vai entender. Em algum momentos nesses quinze anos ele decidiu trocar uma perna por um carrinho de m√£o. Ele deve ter tido seus motivos. 

Mas n√£o tem problema. Depois de uns 30 minutos de papo voc√™ j√° at√© esquece que ele n√£o tem uma anatomia usual por que voc√™ foca em todo o resto que voc√™ conhecia e como voc√™ estava com saudade disso tudo. 

Uma hora voc√™ se despede, promete que ‚Äúv√£o combinar‚Äù  e se pergunta como ficou tanto tempo sem v√™-lo. Uma pessoa t√£o gente boa que nem comentou sobre a assadeira de 40cm que voc√™ agora tem no lugar do p√© direito.

Tem uma m√∫sica brega do final do mil√™nio passado, ‚ÄúI knew i loved you‚Äù da banda Savage Garden.
Nela o cantor declama que sabia que amava a pessoa antes mesmo de a conhecer. Ele tenta explicar melhor com outros versos melosos mas n√£o consegue. Ele s√≥ sabe.

Legal pra ele. Mas e se em vez de pedir um sorvete de baunilha ele pedisse um de chocolate, e a atendente tivesse que ir pegar mais l√° no fundo por que acabou, e com isso ele levasse um minuto a mais para chegar em casa e n√£o dividisse o elevador com o objeto de seu amor? Tava lascado? Forever alone? Quantas coisas tiveram que se encaixar perfeitamente para a profecia se realizar? Num mundo de tantas bifurca√ß√µes, de tantos trens perdidos e mudan√ßas de √∫ltima hora, quantas profecias deixaram de se realizar? Quantas musicas de amor se transformaram em m√∫sicas de dor?

Num mundo onde cada vez mais podemos escolher cada detalhe de nossas vidas, cada passo pode nos levar a um lugar miser√°vel ou magnifico. Basta um tiquinho de ins√¥nia para ficarmos nos perguntando quantas pessoas deixamos de conhecer por n√£o ter feito aquele interc√¢mbio? Ou ter trocado de col√©gio no √∫ltimo ano de ensino fundamental? (Seja l√° que s√©rie seja essa).

A cada decis√£o incont√°veis futuros s√£o apagados. (A n√£o ser que acredite em Multiversos).Casada na Toscana com algu√©m que adora o cheiro do canto do seu nariz, solteiro at√© os cinquenta at√© juntar com aquele colega de escola que voc√™ nem gostava tanto ou idoso de m√£os dadas ap√≥s 50 anos de casamento com uma amiga de sua irm√£. 

Bateu uma ansiedade?

O que esquecemos quando pensamos em tudo que n√£o tivemos √© tudo que tivemos. O que aconteceu, se realizou. Quantas coisas tiveram que dar certo pra voc√™ ter em sua vida as pessoas que mais ama hoje. Quantos encontros, esbarros, supernovas, sementes, sims e n√£os tiveram de acontecer para voc√™ chegar aqui? Hoje. As chances s√£o t√£o √≠nfimas que qualquer estat√≠stico consideraria zero. E mesmo assim voc√™ est√° aqui. Desafiando qualquer probabilidade. Deixando de conhecer zilh√µes para amar menos de duas m√£os cheias. E valeu a pena.

Intimidade √© um dos melhores medidores de um relacionamento. Nos abrir, mostrar nossos defeitos e vulnerabilidades s√£o prova pr√°tica do quanto nos entregamos ao outro. Mas tudo tem um limite. 

Na minha casa n√£o t√≠nhamos pessoas peladas. Todos se vestiam decentemente para ir at√© a cozinha. Gra√ßas a prosperidade financeira cada um tinha seu banheiro. A vida era boa. 

At√© que fui ouvir as hist√≥rias de amigos. Uns que achavam que soltar gases na frente do outro era quest√£o de orgulho. Outros que dividiam a escova de dente. E at√© uns que dividiam o banheiro. Enquanto um usa o vaso o outro usa o chuveiro. Muito pr√°tico. 

A minha ligeira n√£o concord√¢ncia com tais atitudes me garantiram o r√≥tulo de fresco. Eu aceito. Mas ainda assim n√£o entendo como as pessoas n√£o enxergam que est√£o erradas. 

Somos esquisitos com palavras. Em espec√≠fico para necessidades f√≠sicas. ‚ÄúVou mijar‚Äù, grosso, ‚ÄúVou urinar‚Äù, onde? Num tubo de ensaio? ‚ÄúVou fazer xixi‚Äù, t√° bom, chama sua m√£e quando terminar. ‚ÄúManh√™, acabei!‚Äù.

A solu√ß√£o para isso tudo √© controlar toda sua intimidade e necessidade de anunciar feito um bardo da idade m√©dia o que vai fazer. N√£o pode dizer apenas que vai ao banheiro? Se algu√©m precisar saber maiores detalhes pode simplesmente perguntar ‚Äúvai demorar?‚Äù. Sutil. 

Intimidade √© legal mesmo, mas se n√£o usarmos com parcim√¥nia perde todo valor. Poder fazer n√£o significa que devemos fazer. 

Agora com licen√ßa, vou at√© o banheiro.

Num r√©veillon do meio da d√©cada de 90 fui para casa de uns amigos dos meus pais na praia. Eles tinham filhos que foram amigos de inf√¢ncia mas as coisas estavam come√ßando a se complicar. Adolesc√™ncia. 

N√£o lembro de muitas coisas mas recordo bem de duas noites. 

Na virada fomos pra um bar/festa. Tocava muito Bob Marley, eu n√£o fumava maconha e minha amiga se arranjou rapidinho. Eu n√£o. Aqui entre n√≥s, eu n√£o era muito bom em me arranjar. 

A noite passou devagar e eu voltei pra casa amontoado num buggy. 

A segundo noite que decidi ficar em casa em vez de sair com os amigos. Lembro do quarto vazio, apenas a luz da lua iluminava o quarto, projetando a sombra das p√°s do ventilador de teto. Eu estava numa beliche, n√£o parte de cima com um caderninho. Era o come√ßo da minha aventura como escritor. Eu adorava poesia. Me pergunto por que ser√° que eu n√£o era bom em me arranjar. 

Encontrei esse caderno depois de adulto. Entre diversas tentativas de ser o pr√≥ximo Olavo Bilac, uma quest√£o solta: Como voc√™ est√° no futuro?

Bem, Kris do passado, voc√™ finalmente se arranjou, est√° escrevendo isso ao lado da sua esposa. Seu cachorro n√£o se decide se dorme na cama ou no ch√£o e voc√™ ainda n√£o sabe escrever poesia.

This is from a series of portraits I made about Lancaster people in their regular haunts. He was very amused as I spent half an afternoon trying to get just 'the right warm glow' to the the pint.

He was, of course, much more than that.

8908,"That kid in the ball cap is on a college campus today taking a test and it scares the living daylights out of me. It's not the test or results that I fear -- he'll do great and the results don't matter to me. What scares me is the fact that in a very short time, he'll be doing this all on his own. No parachute, no dad sitting in the hallway for three hours to give him a hug when he's done. He'll figure out where the business office is to write a check, he'll sign all of the paperwork himself, he'll remember on his own to use the restroom beforehand; and I just hope that when he's done, he'll at least give me a call and look for a virtual hug. Moments like this make me realize I need that hug just as much as he does... go get 'em Cohen, I know you've got this but it sure is hard watching it happen so fast!

8914,"For the last 6 months we've been renovating a historic home in downtown Grapevine, TX. It is not for the faint of heart. 
We were finally able to move in last week and are going through the slow process of getting things like mirrors, curtains, and towel racks hung. 
I didn't do a great job of posting pictures throughout but will try and catch up with a few after the fact. 
This great room used to be 4 separate rooms with a pantry and water heater closet right in the middle. Most of the floors throughout the house are original 2"" red oak from 1954 which we sanded and refinished with an almost clear stain that just had a small amount of white mixed in. They turned out fantastic. 
The kitchen is completely brand new with an 8' island added in for good measure. 
What you don't see here is that the window next to the kitchen is soon to be replaced with another door and steps down to the back patio and pool area.

8915,"Yes, this is a picture of a bathroom and yes, I'm kind of fond of the floor. I wanted to put some fancy type in the floor with, ""wash your hands"" or ""you look nice today"" but the decision maker in the house wasn't having any of it.
.
Prior to the remodel, this bathroom didn't exist. There was a third toilet in the house but it was oddly located in the laundry room. One can only assume that folding laundry while using the facilities is a little known, proper time-management technique. Noted.
.
For this one we did a matte finish 1"" hexagon tile in black and white. You might notice a couple pieces of tape on the floor though where we're going to change out the colors due to our OCD-ness and the pattern being a little off.
.
Come and visit and I'll let you use this little gem of a half-bath; I won't even charge you for it.

11677,I can‚Äôt believe I have the final design of Suklob. It fits the iPad Pro perfectly while keeping the Apple Pencil secured. It‚Äôs a case for modern designers and illustrators who used the iPad Pro as their creative tool. The outer case is a handwoven banig made by the local communities. I love the inner lining made of handwoven fabric from Marawi with just the right amount of cushion for protection. What started as a simple idea bounced off with @woven.ph two years ago‚Äî the result is beautiful and functional. You can still get your Suklob on their online store with a discount. #ipadsleeve #wovenph #banig,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

On the desktop I‚Äôve enjoyed it, but I do miss a second screen at least sometimes. At work I leave my MacBook open but only have my bullet journal in view. I was making some patch updates to a personal project last night and felt I should have that extra screen there, but after some time I realised I was getting the things I wanted done quickly. See, without another screen you have to be focused on what you are doing; if you do have two different things on one screen, then it needs to be high value to take up precious pixels.

Doing some more traditional development and research, that second monitor was sorely missed. I‚Äôm feeling going back to using a second display that‚Äôs ‚Äú1080‚Äù will be a step backwards. Whilst the point of a single monitor is focus, sometimes what you need to focus on requires a lot of space so even that secondary focus, to have it in view fully would benefit from a bigger display. I‚Äôve got a week and a bit of work left this year so still time to refine this setup before making the choice of to stick to single life or double up... or triple up!

Been good simple learning curve with it and really building that foundation of this is what I need to be using going forward.

What have others build their site in? Be interesting to see how many people still do dynamic sites over static generators.

Working on a internal CLI tool to help with some workflows; hopefully cut time down from 5-15 minutes of work to... one command. Writing a CLI I‚Äôm finding myself massively reliant on tests to check each part of the process, though some are going to be tricky to check without manual intervention. It‚Äôs the nature of this little beast.

The CLI is being written in TypeScript. I know some folks will say ‚Äúwhy not python‚Äù or ""why not bash""? Well sometimes using the best technical tool for the job is not the most apt tool for the environment. Due to a number of business and technical choices around this, a JS/TypeScript solution works perfectly. The barrier to entry for this CLI is super low and doesn't require much setup (install node, install package). The idea is for folks to run 'n go, and this tech stack does it perfectly. If it was a previous job then it would of been PHP, but I'm not using that tech stack no longer so it's a no-go.

Naturally, if you're short on your Amazon Prime Now order, it only seems right to  buy a bottle of something and this little whisky found it's way into my basket. An odd choice of cart filler at 9 the morning, but what can I say...

Really, what?

Aberlour 10 year old single malt is one of those whiskies you won't mistaken for scotch. In a good way this has some of the characteristic of that typical Scotch whisky; the sweet woody caramel flavours and a hint of pear that has a spice that lingers after you finish. I've heard folks refer to this sort of whisky as a ""breakfast whisky"" (maybe that's why I ordered it at 9am); it's a taste you can sip on all day and enjoy whilst not getting too involved in it's flavours. It's a good whisky to keep in!

I often get asked about alcohol and how it affects my diabetes and the short answer it that is depends. I have found that whisky is the best for me as it doesn‚Äôt affect my sugars in any real way that limits me. Beers are interesting as some will drop my sugars and others will increase them, and that varies not just type but brand as well. It‚Äôs a little bit of a guessing game at times but you can sometimes quickly tell how it‚Äôs going to go just from how your lips react.

Today, Americans have made their choice on their next President Elect to be Biden and Harris as Vice-President Elect. Without getting too political, this affects people‚Äôs diabetes in the states as their medication isn‚Äôt free and their choice in leader will have a meaningful impact. Trump previously said he‚Äôs getting insulin ‚Äúso cheap, it‚Äôs like water‚Äú, but for a number of people it‚Äôs far from it. Many America diabetics die from lack of access. I often see in American groups diabetics, or their care givers, asking how gangrene their foot can go before they need to do something about it. Common one is how to engineer vials to get that scrap of insulin out of it. Things we don‚Äôt ever think about in the UK as we have the NHS. But I do hope for America that Biden and Harris will expand the Affordable Care Act making insulin more accessible for all.

Here‚Äôs the two hypodermics I rely on everyday. The orange one is a rapid acting insulin that works along side eating a meal, so I do that 3 times a day.

Did you know that dogs can be used as alert aids for diabetics to tell if they are high or low? Not sure how common place this is with the advent of digital devices but they can be trained to sniff out or notice changes in a human to warn they need to take action or even help them. Also, as animals help calm people‚Äôs mental state it can be said they could also assist in better control just by being there (not saying this as fact but my own personal experience). This dog here though? Useless as a diabetic alert dog! But she‚Äôs not trained and just want strokes.

I spoke a little about the FreeStyle Libre already this month, but it‚Äôs been a massive change to my treatment it‚Äôs worth sharing more. This is the little device on my arm; a filament under the taking reading on my blood sugars. The bit you see I believe acts as the storage and RFID device so I can tap my phone against it and get a reading. It‚Äôs waterproof, shower proof and can take a fair old knocking (found this out when I was in Italy last year). I‚Äôll keep one of these on for around 2 weeks then swap to the next one.

So, today is my nan‚Äôs birthday. She died last year and it‚Äôs been strange as well as sad not having her around. But I‚Äôve many fond memories of her and a lot of my vivid ones where her with my diabetes. Stories of her learning to inject me using an orange, then doing injections like she was throwing a dart! Blood tests where always feet in a bowl of warm water and then using my toes to get then blood. If my sugars where high she make me run up and down the stairs. Genuinely, she made it seem like having diabetes was fun, despite growing older I knew how much it pained her to do things that are inherently painful to me. But she never showed that side, she made it an everyday thing.

I‚Äôve said before I get bouts of anxiety and that really affects my blood sugars. Sometimes these are justified and others they come out of the blue and can make you feel awful. To combat these waves I find being hyper focused on something takes that away, and my go to is playing skilled/hard games or games with a lot of story. I‚Äôm focused on the story and the challenge, thinking moves ahead whilst understanding what‚Äôs going on. My brain is doing a lot of work and almost resets itself and forgets about the anxiety. It‚Äôs amazing that thanks to tech like the Libre I can see the results of being anxious to that refocused that it does really help.

Let‚Äôs talk COVID-19 and diabetes. See, diabetic‚Äôs are in the extremely clinically vulnerable shielding group, but we‚Äôre still heightened as a clinical group. There have been a higher number of deaths of those with diabetes over the age of 40 than without - our ‚ÄúCOVID age‚Äù is somewhat increased. This is due to how our bodies cope when we get unwell as we‚Äôll find ourselves insulin resistant, meaning that we‚Äôll need to tighten control of blood sugars and possible increase the amount of insulin we‚Äôll need to do. Whilst blood sugars are high, we are more prone to complications and this starts a extremely up-hill battle. We have specialist ‚Äúsick day rules‚Äù to follow that help control blood sugars and get us on the mend, but as COVID-19 is still new and not much is known, it‚Äôs advice is the best we can go on without knowing much else. A number of diabetes groups are heavily researching the effects of the virus on diabetics to help reduce the risks and provide the best advice they can offer, it‚Äôs still best advice to stay away and keep wearing the mask. If I‚Äôm honest, I like wearing a mask, got an outlaw feel to it!

A news article today from the BBC spoke about ‚Äúdiabetes burnout‚Äù and how diabetics suffer from issues like depression and anxiety, but also eating disorders. Whilst I‚Äôve never been in the latter camp, the first two I know well. Your life is a constant act of working out what you need to do to stay ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. It‚Äôs constantly preempting the day; do I need to take insulin, should I bring my night, when will I eat, will I be able to get enough carb, will I have too much carb, should I even eat that... you need to make a number of judgment calls in a day that can effect thing drastically. You are forever assessing yourself and then judging when you make the wrong actions. You don‚Äôt ever pat yourself on the back as a good day is being a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person. There‚Äôs a reason why diabetics need to be regularly screen for mental health issues as a day can be a massive mind fuck, and that day can carry on for weeks or months. You can hit a wall and say ‚Äúnah, can‚Äôt be bothered‚Äù and then you really start to go downhill. This is why I try to be a easy going solutions focus person; there‚Äôs enough stress to worry about so I rather not add to it.

Having a house full of Alexa decide I used that to set a strict routing and reminder to do my night time insulin. See, the night one needs to be done at a particular time every night and can be the worse one to forget. 22:45 every night, the lights come on to the kitchen and an announcement is made to the whole house to say I need to do it. Now I never forget to do it and nor does anybody else in the house!

Freestyle Libre sensor change over day! Every two weeks I go through this process and today I have the luxury of Kerrie helping me do the process. Four photos today so I‚Äôll explain...

1. Removing the old sensor, you can see the adhesive residue on my arm and the hole where the filament goes under my skin.

2. This is the applicator, and yes, that a huge fuck off needle in there to make things go in! I‚Äôll be honest, it rarely hurts, you do feel it but that‚Äôs a good thing as you know it‚Äôs done it‚Äôs job.

3. Lining up the location for the location for the sensor. Luckily my arms are either defined or loose, bluish average, which helps find a good flattish location.

4. And job is done! Another two weeks of readings ready to go.

Jelly Babies! These things are a life saver, fact. It‚Äôs often thought that diabetics should never eat sweets (or anything with sugar), but that‚Äôs not true, we just need to be careful and mindful of our eating habits. That‚Äôs goes for anything really. But, when we have low blood sugars and go into a hypo, 4-6 jelly babies can literally save our life. They are coated in sugar, made with a lot of sugar, and have hardly any fat, that means that our body will start processing them really quickly and help bring our sugar levels up to normal range. So, sugar can be very good for you (damn same we still have to pay VAT on these things in the UK).

Here‚Äôs my kitchen floor. Why have I taken this picture? It was five years ago today I had a seizure on this very floor that made me realise that I had to take my diabetes so much more seriously than did. It was a waking hypo, so I was groggy any way, but Kerrie spotted it and went down stairs to get my jelly babies and stuff. For some reason I followed her down and into the kitchen. That‚Äôs when I dropped to the floor and started fitting. Not that I remember any of this but seeing the worry it put on so many people‚Äôs faces after the fact changed my perspective. I‚Äôm lucky that the worse thing out of it was I lost my driving license for a year and everybody else had to drive me places.

One of the key things you can do as a diabetic is carb counting. The idea is you can work out how much insulin you need to do based on how much carb you have (where you can count it as not all carb is equal). I find working out sums in my head a pain so I did what I know best and made a carb calculator app, a Carbulator if you will! Food that shows you carbs per serving are great, but you may need to accurately add multiple, then you get the ones that tell you per 100g and then it gets tricky for me. So this does both and gives you an accurate whole number to work out your insulin dosage with! Little things making life a little easier.

How do you feel about a bit of maths every time you eat? This is the sort of calculations a diabetic will have to work out to keep their blood sugars in check and know how much insulin to give themselves. It a lot to process when you just want to chow down. Some diabetics will have their meals planned out and pre-calculated for the day so they are ready to eat knowing the insulin dosage they need; but that‚Äôs only half. If you need extra insulin due to high sugars, you need to work that out. This only works out the carbs in food, nothing else, so if you do more or less activity in a day then that throws all that out. Hell, some days your body doesn‚Äôt want to play ball and those figures don‚Äôt even fly.

Feet are an important thing, or things rather, and we often don‚Äôt think about foot care that much. For a diabetic it‚Äôs one of the main problem areas we can have. All those nerve endings can be damaged due to excessive blood sugars and cause things such as nerve damage leading to insensitivity to gangrene that would mean amputation. It‚Äôs one of the most common issues I‚Äôve seen diabetics have is their feet, and more extreme issues too. I tried to look my feet (sans-socks of course) and see if there‚Äôs anything unusual, including if there are any sharp objects in them and the loss of sensitivity can be so bad you don‚Äôt know they are there.

Eyes are another point of issue with diabetics. Again with the blood vessels and high blood sugars, the eye can become easily damaged with most diabetics over 10 years developing some form of retinopathy. It‚Äôs where the blood vessels start to break down and bleed out. I have background retinopathy, but this is to be expected and is nothing to worry about. If I leave my eyes unchecked or ignore high blood sugars over a period of time, my eye sight can start to be affected and eventually blindness. This is one of the more worrying things for me for a number of reasons. Having yearly checks helps combat against any future possibilities as it can take a while to get to that serious stage.

Sometimes the issue with diabetes can immediately scare you, and freak you out. Suffering a really horrible low; paranoia, waking nightmare, and complete sense of unease.

Well, after last night hypo okay again now. This is how quickly things can turn around; one moment you are sitting down fine, the next your freaking out with extreme paranoia, living an actual waking nightmare and massively unsettling constant deja-vu. But today, I‚Äôm a lot better and even went out and got a christmas and carried it home! So I‚Äôm more than okay now. But now I‚Äôm more with it I can try to explain it better. Your body is aware and awake but your brain is struggling to work. It‚Äôs confusing thoughts in your head with what‚Äôs in the real world, but with the normalcy of my anxiety being high ten in hypo, everything starts to go wrong. You‚Äôre seeing things that aren‚Äôt there, you‚Äôre feelings are completely foreign, you are not your own person but an observer in a body you want far from. It took a while for me to come back around and even then I was still dipping in and out of that state. All I could think, outside some pretty horrific thoughts, is ‚Äúwhy is this happening?‚Äù The recovery is never quick and it‚Äôs a delicate balance of getting something quick acting and something long acting to keep you up, buts there‚Äôs a super delicate balance with that; it‚Äôs easier to not worry about going high and just eat loads (LOADS) of jelly babies and then and some thing fibrous. It‚Äôs not easy when it goes wrong, but luckily I had people around me to keep my head in the right place, hate to be by myself when that happens as the worst could very easily happen.

After having that rather long low (followed by night hypo), I thought I should treat myself to running a little higher than normal. Want to treat myself so been enjoying having some seasonal goodies in the form of Lebkuchen cookies. Being diabetic doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt have there things, just in moderation, which people should be doing any way. Plus, the great thing about moderation is the impact having something like this on the taste buds is more intense.

My last post on Blue November and it‚Äôs after a day of nothing exciting diabetes-wise, which is a really good thing! So I‚Äôll finish off with selfie showing that diabetes looks like me; it‚Äôs not a fat person, nor skinny person; young or old person; just a average person that happens to have type 1 diabetes. I didn‚Äôt do anything to get it and probably won‚Äôt know why I even got diabetes in the first place; there are ideas, but nothing established as fact. Everyday can be something different and scary, it can also be a boring day. Diabetes is a day-by-day treatment. But as much as it‚Äôs apart of me, as we like to say, I am more than my highs and lows. This is why I spend a month doing this; to show a side I don‚Äôt often publicly tsk about because this is my normal life that I‚Äôm very content with so to me it seems pretty boring but I massively appreciate the fact that so many people find this interesting and informative. I really hope everybody who has followed this month has learned a little something; and that‚Äôs all I ask is you come away from these a little more informed. So thanks to everybody for the messages, likes and comments. As always, any questions on type 1 diabetes, please feel free to ask me (no matter how you feel about the question. 

Again, thank you all!

From the taste, I'm going to say this is from a sherry cask, probably Oloroso over PX, with that dry sweetness of currents and nuts with a slight marzipan/almond edge to it. Not sure if it's a blended whisky (guessing no), but I get hints of bourbon as well, making me think it sat in one of those casks for a period. The finish is dry and long, which now makes me think this is a cask strength!

It's a whisky I would defiantly buy. It's that falvour profile I like and that experience of a good after-dinner whisky, but not an all-nighter. I like a whisky that you can pour a dram, sip, enjoy and put away for another night. Now to find out what it is... @whiskyswimmer?

12033,"Few weeks ago I changed my monitor positions. Turns out since moving the desk I might have not position my left monitor correctly and thus cause a bad muscle strain on my left of my neck. So rather than the primary/secondary monitor style, I've gone for dual primary monitor (the MacBook is just... there). Been a long time since I've done that style but it appears to be working as my neck is recovering, slowly. Dare say lack daily walks doesn't help, but that's life right now!

I've had to adjust how I typically have a lot of my app windows. So far so good with this; moving my head more and not just in one direction either. It also allows me to focus on either screen when I need to by turning my body a little to that screen.

What do you folks think? How do you have your monitors setup?

12034,"Been playing Watch Dogs: Legion as my primary game currently. It's quite fun to tear around and cause havoc in a city I know well, if a little confusing. ""Hey, that hotel we staid at it just up this road... oh wait, I'm in a different borough now"". The different characters you can recruit and play as it a nice little touch and with perma-death on you gain a little attachment to some, and others you quite happy march them into a suicide mission because they just won't stop farting - yeah, that's a thing!

The voice acting and writing leaves a lot to be desired; pretty sure Londoner's don't swear _that_ much. Ray-tracing is amazing to look at, and being England is famous for rain, it's constantly on show, the shame though is it's locked at 30fps. Ah well, it's a fun game and a nice distraction to be able to wonder around London in current times!

What's everyone else playing?

After my tasting last week bringing my guess work into questioning, I‚Äôve gone for the safe option of one of my @drinksbythedram samples. It‚Äôs a small batch Elijah Craig Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey (47%). One I‚Äôve wanted to try for a while and something that doesn‚Äôt disappoint!

Sweet syrupy wood smells fill your nose that marries with the deep colour of this Bourbon. Pallet has that nice wood flavour that has that caramel sweetness with a little corn sweetness as well. But the finish; I‚Äôm not one for finishes often by this has an amazing long lasting aroma that coats your mouth beautifully and even your nasal passage (it‚Äôs a good thing)! Not something I‚Äôm a fan of, but I can see why people opt for a cigar with this as that finish works well with a smoke in the background. 

Might have to ask @thelittlewhiskyshop to get a bottle of this for myself! It‚Äôs deffo one to have in when I can have a fire in the garden, has that feel about it. A comforting, happy place feeling! üò∏

Not much on it yet as I only just got it, but I assure every part of every sheet will have some form of writing covering it before I flip it over and use the reverse sides.

Moving the desks back to their previous position has allowed me to test a setup I've always fancied. It's an experiment, for now, to see how I get on. If I like it, I might invest in it further.

I ordered a new screen lamp as none of the ones I had would provide enough light on the desk due to the screens being too big. So went for screen lamp that seems to be giving off a lot of light I onto the desk area and none into my eyes or screens. Will try for a bit longer to given an honest opinion on it.

12039,"That time of the week where I pick a dram and tell you what I think and probably do an awful job explaining flavours... It's Whisky Wednesday!

Today's dram from @drinksbythedram is a Deanston 14-Year-Old Organic Single Malt, 46.3% ABV. Not knowingly tried an organic so that's something different here, but it's a highland whisky, which is normally an easy drinker, nothing offensive, but enough to let you know you're drinking a whisky.

On the nose with this one, it took me a while but it initially had a somewhat earthy aroma but didn't seem right. A few more sniffs it struck me as a mix of fresh cooking apples and sweet malt. The taste clears it brings out that sweet baking flavours of pears and muscovado; a very warming sensation. I often say that this sort fo profile in a whisky is after dinner one, a desert whisky, but that doesn't fit here. An autumn whisky for sure with the finish having a medium length spice to it. I think this is one for a fireworks night or Halloween; a whisky to watch the leaves change colour. A nice understated whisky that wouldn‚Äôt go amiss in a collection.

‚Äî‚Äî

If you‚Äôre reading this far down, may I suggest you follow @wessexwhiskyclub? We‚Äôre doing monthly tastings via Zoom and this week we‚Äôre sampling @pauljohnwhisky, so something a little different! Follow, or join, and see about coming song to one of our friendly sessions.

12041,"Wow, a busy week so far, hence no uploads as of yet. But tonight is Whisky Wednesday and so I must face that horrible task of opening a dram of something and sampling its liquid insides.

Tonight is my last dram of @drinksbythedram's Xmas collection and it's @theglenallachie_ 15-Year-Old Single Malt at 46% ABV.

Now, the nose I immediately get that distinct raisin smell with that caramel or butterscotch hint and possibly apple or pears right at the end there. The colour of this whisky might be skewing my views as, well... look at how deep that oaky brown is! Almost the same shade as my table. The taste is very interesting, nothing I was expecting; it's almost bitter like dark chocolate, or even akin to a chocolate sauce you'll pour over venison. But the raisin flavours are super strong in this one, reminds me of the red box raisins eating them as a kid. There are spices flowing in there around the woody notes. The finish is short with this one with more of the aromas staying around rather than the flavours itself.

This is an odd mix, in a good way, of an all-nighter but also a savour whisky. Probably more of the all-nighter one as I could easily be drinking this one around friends having a gas. It makes me want to try more of the GlenAllachie range now as it's a very distinct ""scotch"" that I'd love to keep in for folks to try.

Been nice though as I‚Äôm aiming to get Watch Dogs: Legion finished to get back into Assassin‚Äôs Creed (Black Flag is next). Keep meaning to get into The Medium on XSX but the pacing is a little off so struggling to get involved in it. 

Had some fun last night gaming with friends as well. Jack Box games and some Rocket League for good measure! Let it be known, playing on PS5 against PS4 does not help even when hosting... 

What do you folks recommend for local-mixed-remote multiplayer games? Mario Kart is on the list as well but looking for more ideas.

12043,"Finished Watch Dogs: Legion! Gameplay-wise this was a really good romp; having permadeath on made me more attached to the characters but also forced me to diversify. Exploring London was awesome, spending time away from the main gameplay loop to find locations including a scene from Love Actually that contains one of my favourite lines in cinema (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a self preservation thing...‚Äù). The story and writing was a little, meh, but that last story did save it. That last 15 minutes of exposition was worth the whole experience for me with the final scene playing out in the building behind my character. 

Oh, that ray-tracing after a good rain fall was amazing! Can‚Äôt help but stare.

Well worth the time for this game. Might look at getting the season pass for this, see what extra will be coming!

12044,"It's Wednesday and I have a whisky. As is the tradition I shall obnoxiously taste it and provide my level headed feedback that is more akin to somebody who is drunk and is trying to sound like they know what the hell they are talking about.

Today is a dram of Bunnahabhain 12-year-old single malt (46.3% ABV) from @summertonclub ! They sent out their bi-monthly bottle this week (which is rather nice I must say) and provided this sample with it. I've tried a few rarer Bunnahabhains plus their Sti√πireadair (which I've posted about previously) and their range is quite complex. Whilst not massively into their Sti√πireadair, I've heard great things about this whisky.

Normally with a whisky from Islay, you are expecting peat but @bunnahabhain doesn't typically follow suit, which is no different here. The nose immediately brings up spiced sun-dried fruits with a sweeter floral sense towards the end there; reminds me of a strong (alcohol) wine at the end. The taste is rich with nuts and fruit, trail mix wise with that almonds, apple, cashews and citrus peel with a little toffee in there somewhere. That finish is quick but fragrant with a little dryness to it, almost coats the mouth. No peat in this for me or even smoke, so if you aren't into that then you are very safe with this bottle.

I can see why Summerton sent this sample with their main bottle. I like it! I've been looking at buying this for a while now but wasn't sure and ended up getting something else, but I think I'll need to have one of these in as a keeper. It's got a lot going for it at a reasonable price tag (around ¬£40 for a 70cl). Well worth a try!

Must say, using three screens like this has been amazing for my neck. On primary display and then two secondaries means my head moves around a lot more in both directions. No muscle build up on one side of my neck means no pain! Plus, I think excising more has helped with that as strict lockdown made me a bit lazy. Fingers crossed not much longer!

Rather than ‚Äútaste‚Äù a whiskey I‚Äôve opted to ‚Äúdrink‚Äù Irish tonight. Currently my favourite whisk(e)y is the @redbreastirishwhiskey, these two (12 year and Lustau) being awesome, rich, full of flavour whiskies. I‚Äôll be honest, my wife and I polished a bottle of the 12 year old in over a week, it‚Äôs that good we keep a bottle as a main stay (along with a bottle of Jameson of course). Both whiskies have a beautiful, almost full bodied, Sherry flavour that‚Äôs perfect for sipping and savouring that has a finish that lasts for a while. 

Plus, this was distilled in Midleton, Co. Cork so you cannot go wrong with it! üòÅ

The story has a good grasp on me and the survival mechanics aren‚Äôt too much of a hinderance on gameplay flow. The only downside is the procedurally generated world. I feel the world itself could have been more a character than an environment if it was curated by hand rather than generated. But still an interesting story with a premise that‚Äôs quite gripping. As for the bugs? I‚Äôve not come across anything serious or takes me out on the immersion massively. So if you‚Äôve fancied trying We Happy Few but have been unsure in the past, might be worth a shot now.

12049,"It‚Äôs Whiskey Wednesday again, also it‚Äôs St. Patrick‚Äôs Day! A day where all the Plastic Paddy‚Äôs are Irish natives, everybody is a Plastic Paddy and the natives... are native.

I decided to go off the beaten Irish Whiskey path and opted for a lesser known name of @egansirishwhiskey, this one being the Fortitude bottle. Don‚Äôt normally see Irish whiskies going above 44% (least I haven‚Äôt) so to have one at 46% is a nice division from the norm. Also, away from the norm for me, this is distilled in Co, Offaly; you see, I‚Äôm very much of Co. Cork whiskies (my family being around the Midleton area). So something in the very heart of Ireland makes good sense for St. Paddy‚Äôs.

Exclusively matured in PX casks, this really comes through on the nose and taste with the distinct sun-dried raisin flavour that‚Äôs sweet and smooth to a marzipan finish. It‚Äôs a rare flavour of whiskey that is one to really savour. 

For those who love a good Sherry cask whisky/whiskey, I can highly recommend this one and suggest giving this a try, even if you‚Äôre not into Irish whiskies.

I thought the name was a Offspring reference but it‚Äôs a reference to the late/great Adam West‚Äôs hometown in Washington state. But this is an amazingly citrus smelling beer with a light refreshing, but hoppy, pallet that will do good as a strong (at 5.5% ABV) session beer. Something to have in for the BBQ and English summer evenings around the fire pit.

The chaps at @batcountrybrewco have done an awesome job with their first beer. If you like your craft beers then I cannot recommend trying this one enough.

Great work guys!

12144,"This is a typical Saturday night drink for me, a glass of whiskey. Not normally this much but I‚Äôm getting rid of a bottle! Any way, I like a drink and this is fine for my diabetes, the main thing I need to be aware of is alcohol can lower blood sugars. This can be a bit of a concern when going out for a session as I need to weigh up the sugar content of a drink against the alcohol. What works for me is high alcohol as most of the sugar is gone, so all I need to is top up on carbs. What has happened due to this also is my tolerance is rather high, so if I‚Äôm acting a bit ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù the more logical issue is I‚Äôm low. It‚Äôs a way of enjoying yourself and feeling the nicer affects of alcohol without the worries of high blood sugars or confusion of drunk or low. I‚Äôm not a fan of getting drunk either way, I drink for flavour hence my enjoyment of rather expensive whiskies! #type1 #type1diabetic #type1diabetes #t1d #diabetic #diabetes #bluenovember #diabetesawareness #diabetesawarenessmonth #bluenovemberüíô #alcohol #whiskey #whisky #whiskygeek",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Luckily, working from home, I can get my self to a point where I can focus and carry on working. With perseverance I managed to get my tasks done for the day!

12149,"One of the biggest issues I have with diabetes is not the blood tests or injections or the really crap feelings I have. Nope, it‚Äôs the fact that I‚Äôm limited in what I can drink. The amount of soft drinks with sugars/carbs in them is the worst. Even if they say sugar free or ‚Äúzero‚Äù sugar, they could have carbs; more often than not nowadays. You may see me drink mainly Pepsi Max as that‚Äôs what I know is safe and the only thing that tastes good for me. Fruit juices, flavoured waters and also health drinks are shockingly bad for me. Weirdly, this is mainly an issue in the UK; in places like Ireland and Canada, I can often pick a whole range of drinks to have with a true 0.0 carb content. Seems like a minor thing, and it is, but when your out and want a quick drink of something other than water, you‚Äôre massively limited. If the UK truly wants to stop kids drinking sugary drinks, then maybe do more to incentivise getting true sugar free drinks in the market.

12152,"I love lazing at home playing video games. I‚Äôm somewhat healthy, I try and go to the gym when I can and I eat fairly healthy (not ‚Äúdiet‚Äù healthy, which 90% of it is bull). Some may see my video game lifestyle as s possible reason why I‚Äôm diabetic. Many people think diabetes is directly related to being overweight; this is not true for type 1 or type 2. Closest thing true to that is being overweight may increase likelihood of type 2 diabetes, but it‚Äôs not a deciding factor. In fact most people with type 2 aren‚Äôt overweight and most overweight don‚Äôt develop it (I think that‚Äôs source from Diabetes UK, but I can fact check if anybody queries that). With regards to my diabetes, type 1, it‚Äôs most likely caused by genetics and unknown factors. Anybody can develop it at any time but type 1 is most likely to occur at development stages in life. So, if somebody has diabetes, you‚Äôll be mostly wrong to assume it‚Äôs their lifestyle. Actually, I found out recently there‚Äôs a whole host of body building groups that are made up of type 1 and 2 diabetics, so healthy people can be diabetic! #type1 #type1diabetic #type1diabetes #t1d #diabetic #diabetes #bluenovember #diabetesawareness #diabetesawarenessmonth #bluenovemberüíô",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

.
In the meantime, it was kinda awesome to wake up and ""go to work"" knowing that clay was waiting for me. Most other classes I've taught have been at night, as has been my own time to make work. I think I could get used to this. Goodbye computer and desk, hello clay and wheel!",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
13702,Took about an hour into this test fire to find out that it would fail. Luckily I was sitting next to the kiln working and heard the cup explode and stopped the firing before the other pieces got ruined too. I shouldn't be surprised. I stupidly put a not quite dry piece in extreme temperatures. I'll use this as a teaching moment for the boys tomorrow and be able to show them how destructive steam and gasses can be! #experimentanddiscover #ohwell #explodedkiln #potteriastudio #testfire #clay,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

There is something so satisfying about drinking from this mug. Maybe it's because I held off so long from buying it. Probably more so it's just the thoughtful and efficient design, the perfectly flared and comfortable lip, the buttery and understated glaze, or the tactile throwing ridges that I can't keep my hands off of.

I tell my students ‚ÄúIf you aren‚Äôt centered, then your clay won‚Äôt be.‚Äù Potting is as much a state of mind as it is technical skill. My mind wasn‚Äôt here. Yet, each one of these pots shows an imperfection that flowed out from my center today, and maybe that‚Äôs exactly what I needed. The crud had to come out.

So.. the @penlandschool Workshop I am teaching filled on the first day.  But... I am teaching a very different one at my pottery in Wisconsin this summer and I just opened registration today.  Limited to 7 participants, 6 places left.

June 30-July 13.

This is one of my favorite images from the workshop I taught at my pottery in Gresham last summer.  The workshop is called the Intimate Anagama. 
In the image @paulstokstad sits alone with the hot kiln, pouring over the kiln log.  His intensity is matched by the fire beside him.  His involvement is complete and we see him in this intimate moment.

The workshop is designed to create this kind of intense learning experience.  There is community work, there is alone time, there is equal part in decision making, there are demos, a guest artist, community meals and you leave with 12 cubic feet of your own work fired by you.

If you are trying to get a grasp of wood firing, this workshop is for you.

See more details on my website in my profile, or message me.

13741,"This is what the bottom of a mug looks like when it‚Äôs in the middle of being trimmed.  Excess clay is shaved away to do several things: balance the weight of the mug, reveal a level foot ring for the cup to sit on and a place for the glaze to stop, and generally enhance the profile of the mug as a whole. While this task is somewhat hypnotic and relaxing, I‚Äôd much rather improve my throwing so that I can skip this step all together. (And not have a ‚Äúfat-bottomed mug.) I love the process but at a certain point, if you want to make any money at this craft, you have to find ways to make your production more efficient. Goals.

The St. Andrew Undershaft church is one of the few rare churches built around the 15th century which has survived both the Great Fire of London in the 17th century and the Blitz bombing during the second World War. The Church has been partially restored after the IRA's bombings in the 90s.

17378,"I resisted for a long time but finally picked up a road bike. 

Once the COVID shutdown started I‚Äôve been doing longer rides to make up for my lost bike commutes. I also began riding more on roads due to the trails being overcrowded. That led to looking for something that was more comfortable on lengthier outings and easier on the climbs up the hills of Arlington. 

By the time I landed on a bike I wanted there were only two left in the country in my size due to everybody buying bikes this summer. I contacted a shop in Ohio that was willing to ship the bike to my local bike store and even cover the shipping and assembly costs!

Still going to keep the trusty hybrid around for riding with the kids and commuting once I go back in to the office (next year? ü§ûüèª).

17905,"(Crossposted from matthewbogart.net) Several months ago, novelist, comedian, poet, storyteller, and president of Write Bloody Publishing, @derrickbrownpoetry wrote me with a plan. A friend of his was redesigning a huge building in a small town and wanted to turn it into a collection of shops designed by different creators. He wanted Derrick to dream big and design a bookstore.

Derrick told me his plan for Fascination Station. It was to be a train station, with a checkout counter modeled after Grand Central stations information kiosk. It would have cubby holes for reading, set into in the back wall designed like bunks on a train car. Large displays would be inset in arches showing landscapes rolling by. Travel posters advertising departure times for famous fictional destinations would hang on one wall, and shelves would roll away, so folding chairs could pull out from a secret compartment and an audience could watch authors read from the back of a full size caboose, as if they were on a whistle-stop tour.

It sounded wonderful, and Derrick wanted me to draw it.

While I make detailed 3D models for my comics, I‚Äôd never designed something like this. Something that was to become an actual physical place. Something that needed to fit in exact dimensions and be usable by flesh and blood people. It was a heck of a lot of fun, and the illustration came together in no time.

But the reason their light shined so bright is because they've been through the darkest of dark dark darkness. I don't get it. But that kind of light is so deeply moving. That kind of light is compassion. That kind of light is kindness. Kindness. Is. Light. I'm so thankful for those people.

I have been one acquainted with the night.
I have walked out in rain‚Äîand back in rain.
I have outwalked the furthest city light.
I have looked down the saddest city lane.
I have passed by the watchman on his beat
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.
I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
When far away an interrupted cry
Came over houses from another street,
But not to call me back or say good-bye;
And further still at an unearthly height,
One luminary clock against the sky
Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.
I have been one acquainted with the night.

‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä The girls love their Great Grandpa Steed! Bruce David Steed is one of my main hero‚Äôs and I count it as an honor to bear his name. He is always happy, willing to serve, funny, and a great example to those around him!
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
He is a follower of Christ, husband, math teacher, father of 8, fixer-upper, grandfather, painter, really good under-ducker (I know from childhood experience on the old acreage swing), hard worker, stealer of his own grandkids‚Äô ice cream, calf deliverer (and brander), lifelong learner, maker of magical childhoods, great-grandfather, wood bird carver, creative thinker, and servant to all‚Ä¶ to name a few minor attributesüòâ
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Now, back to Bruce‚Äôs Kickapoo JoyJuice‚Ä¶ I remember tearing up every time I drank it as a kid; it was sooo carbonated & yeastyüòñ Somehow tough, I always sought it out at the next family reunion, and eventually I cultivated a taste for it!
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
I aspire to be like my grandpa in so many ways ‚¨ÜÔ∏èsee list above‚¨ÜÔ∏è. So, I was thrilled when Lyndsey suggested I should make labels to cover the A&W root beer bottles. I still need to learn the recipe from the old silver fox himself, but for today it was fun to pay tribute to him by having some Kickapoo JoyJuice of our own!

We stumbled into this church while roaming around the Plaza de Armas in Santiago. The history of this church dates back to the mid-1500s when Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia founded Santiago. Valdivia established a house of worship in the city‚Äôs main square, Plaza de Armas which led to a small cathedral being built around 1600. It's amazing to be in such historical places.

...
But APS is never satisfied; not with hundreds of millions in profits. CEO Don Brandt personally took home millions. All for selling something people could only buy from them ‚Äî and that they *had* to buy.
... It gets hot in the summer in Arizona. Like, 115 degrees hot, daily, for long stretches. In weather like that, you need air conditioning, you need fans ‚Äî you need electricity. Or you die. ...
APS didn‚Äôt *need* the fifty bucks or so that 72-year-old Stephanie Pullman was a few days late in paying when APS decided to cut off her electricity on a 107 degree day. But APS sure *wanted* it.
...
A week later the county sheriff‚Äôs office found Stephanie in her home, dead of environmental heat exposure, her body already decomposing.
...
This will become more common, if we let it. Climate change will make hot days like that more common.

T√§ss√§ meid√§n l√§hettil√§√§n Jaakon fiilikset kev√§√§n ensimm√§isen 10km matkan j√§lkeen Helsinki10:ll√§ pari viikkoa takaperin! üí™üòé // Greeting from our ambassador @jknuutila from his first 10k event this spring: üîú Preparing for the Helsinki Half Marathon - Helsinki 10 ‚úîÔ∏èI haven't raced a 10 K in years so I was a feeling a bit anxious on the race day. Thankfully the weather was warm, maybe even a bit too warm and the course was really familiar to me. ‚úîÔ∏èAfter a light warmup I lined up with the 57:30 pacers and was ready for the race. The sun was shining and I was feeling quite thirsty on the starting line. I figured that it was just the nerves and didn't think much of it at that time. The race started and I managed to keep a good even pace of 5:40 - 5:45 min/km for the first 5 km. ‚úîÔ∏èAt the start of 6 km my lower back started to ache and it affected by breathing rhythm. Luckily I was able to stretch my back while running and was able to continue but at the same time it meant that I slowed down to around 6 min/km pace for the kilometers 7 to 9. I picked up the pace on the final kilometer and crossed the finish line in 58:46. ‚úîÔ∏èFor the upcoming races I have to take a closer look at my fluid intake to make minimize the possibility of cramps or aches along the way. All in all Helsinki 10 was a well organized race with a fast route. I'll be on the starting line next year, that's for sure! üîôJaakko

20874,"The D&D gaming table is done. This was made for my buddy Mike, and the idea was to have a biiiiiig table that would fit 6 players and a DM  comfortably, but still fold away for storage when not in use. It features individual slide-in trays for each player's personal stuff, and plenty of space on the main tabletop for maps, etc. The legs fold up into the main body, the trays store underneath the tabletop, and the two halves collapse and latch together for storage.

The main body was made of Birch and Birch plywood, while the legs are made of solid Red Oak. Everything is stained dark walnut, with about 4 coats of semi-gloss lacquer finish, to provide protection and some spill-proofing. This is by far the largest thing I've built to date, and I learned a ton while doing it.

If any of you are interested in seeing more woodworking projects, behind the scenes stuff, woodshop class photos, and finished projects, I'd very much appreciate if you'd follow me over there and show me some support. If you're just happy you won't have random workshop photos clogging up your feed, that's cool too! I'll continue posting random photography and dog pictures here. See you on the new account (if you're awesome)!

21518,"3 glasses of whiskey in & feeling things:

If there is one thing this pandemic has reinforced for me, it is patience. Patience to wait for things to come; for the universe to provide.

This is a story about being patient.

I probably heard my first Frank Turner song about 8 years ago. He was just starting to get airplay in the US. He headlined Kegs & Eggs in 2013 but I missed it. I was finally finding my feet in Denver & healing after the collapse of a long term relationship. I was dating someone new for the first time &  things were going well. We were making plans, like buying tickets to @frankturner ‚Äôs fall tour that year.

But somewhere along the way that relationship fell apart. Differing love languages. A fear of commitment.

And so I found myself with 2 tickets but no one to go with. As the summer progressed someone new entered my life. I knew it was a bad idea. There were issues from the start. Those little red flags you ignore.

But before I knew it I was dating that new person. And one of the first real dates we had was the FT show I had tickets for. That night was about as perfect a night as I have ever had.

I fell in love that night. With both the girl and the music. One burned bright before exploding & breaking my heart. Which in the end was ok, because I had made it through most of my life without my heart truly being broken. And at the time that‚Äôs exactly what I needed.

The other love endured. FT‚Äôs music has gotten me through every high & low since.

That night at the show, I was so caught up in all of it that I missed buying a poster for the tour.

For 7 years, off & on, I‚Äôve been trying to buy that poster. Had never even seen one for sale.

Until a few weeks ago, when I was idly perusing eBay while stuck back home in TN. And there it was. Priced low enough to win (after a short bidding war). And now it‚Äôs mine.

If‚Äôs really just a piece of paper with an artist‚Äôs design on it. But to me it‚Äôs a connection to that night. That moment with someone new. That feeling of falling in love and knowing there is nothing you can do to stop it.

I haven‚Äôt felt that since.

But I have patience.

21527,"Several months ago at the start of the pandemic I bought a turntable; figuring vinyl would be a good habit to get into while stuck at home.

Of course, once it was delivered I needed a place to put it. So I started shopping for stands/consoles/vinyl storage.

Inspired by @brooklynndodger and @oldfashioneddanny‚Äòs dumpster find turned record console quarantine project, I went on the hunt on craigslist and found this art deco nightstand that looked to be the right size and fit. A lucky break.

It took a while to assemble the necessary tools, stain, supplies, etc. And to research how to strip the paint and refinish it since I‚Äôd never done that before.

The end result is honestly better than I was ever hoping for. I eyeballed the space where the two bottom drawers were when I bought the thing and wasn‚Äôt actually sure vinyl would fit. But it does, perfectly. Sawed right through the crossbar and made a perfect cube.

My dad was always a handy person who did most house projects himself. As an architect he designed and built the second story addition of the house I grew up in. I‚Äôd scare my mom by climbing the scaffolding and hanging out on the roof with him while he worked. He never let me get near the circular saw but I was always allowed to help mix concrete.

I haven‚Äôt often had much reason or need to do that type of stuff on my own as an adult. But it feels really good to take an idea, visualize the result, gather the necessary tools and knowledge, and execute the vision into something you‚Äôre proud of. Highly recommended.

It‚Äôs made for a very fun weekend project and a nice addition to the room. Now I just need my backordered speakers to arrive...UPDATE: Found the speakers on sale for a similar price at another retailer, arriving FRIDAY. YAY!

Once I arrived at the Depot everything came together: 

Convinced the driver to turn around from another delivery to come right away before the folks at the crane company across the street left for the day.

The crane folks weren‚Äôt even supposed to still be there as they had sold the property to a developer and had planned to be moved out by the 1st.

Within about 30 minutes they had a forklift over and my press down the ramp and at the door. Only hiccup was not having a pallet jack at the ready (currently on loan to a board member).

Luckily they were able to grab one of those too and now the press is where she will stay for a bit.

21531,"12 or so years ago a young, friendly, and slightly obnoxious grey and white tuxedo cat showed up on our porch in TN, not long after I had come home from a failed attempt at living and working overseas.

He had a pink collar and was very affectionate and happy. And most importantly, night after night, he just stayed on the porch. He would curl up on this rocking chair, no bigger than the gourd sitting there now.

He caused a ruckus too by killing and gutting a couple of mourning doves, much to my mom‚Äôs horror. But then we‚Äôve always had cats so having kills brought to us has never been surprising (except the live snakes, whoo boy).

Since he wouldn‚Äôt leave we began to feed him. My mom had already taken in two stray cats but eventually she said we could bring him in and she would pay to take him to the vet and get checked out.

We did our due diligence and called shelters and checked if he was chipped. But it was the start of the recession and lots of animals were abandoned. His previous owners were gone.

And so, he came into the house, made friends with the other two cats, and was given the name Brutus, because he brute forced his way into our home.

I was still dealing with the loss of a previous cat, who died under the worst circumstances (falling out a window in Vienna and suffering for a week as vets tried their best to save him).

But it was clear that Brutus was not going to take no for an answer and my mom made it clear that when I moved back to Colorado he would have to go with me.

And so he did.

I was really worried about moving him back with me to TN. I bought a fancy carrier and a thundershirt and calming spray. The first part of the trip was pretty rough. But we made it.

And in the end I realized that home for him wasn‚Äôt the apartment we shared in Denver. Home has always been wherever I am. He is the most affectionate cat I have ever owned. He‚Äôs my buddy, my best friend, and I desperately wish he could live forever.

At least right now, we are here and working through this rough patch together. This is, for both of us, our ancestral home. Where it all began. And where the next phase begins.

You were not mine; but you were my favorite. You were a houseguest through many lonely Thanksgivings, an exuberant greeter whenever I came over, a lover of walks and the outdoors, and completely devoted to your humans. The minute your leash was reached for you lost all control of your excitement and it was glorious. You had a wiggly butt that just would not quit. You always exhibited the utmost control when waiting for permission to eat, even though it was so, so hard for you.

You wanted desperately to be friends with Brutus but learned quickly to give him space when a guest at our place. You forgot this lesson one time and it nearly cost you an eye. Eventually he let you sleep a mere foot away from him on the couch. He tolerated you, which is high praise from a cat.

You cheerfully accompanied me all the way up a 14er once, though you were not enthused once we got to the summit. You enjoyed meeting the bighorn sheep. We were both very thirsty by the time we got down.

You lived a full life and had two companions that loved you deeply. And many more who admired you and cared for you. You were the cutest dog in the world with the most expressive eyebrow muscles imaginable. The faces you would pull brought smiles to everyone.

I am so very sad you are gone, but I am so happy for the time I got to spend with you, and the trust your humans placed in me in letting me  dogsit you over the years.

It‚Äôs where I learned how hard it is to help manage and run an SG on a shoestring budget, how to manage people who helped out to keep things going, and how to keep friends even when we disagreed üá∫üá∏
It‚Äôs where we drank to the success of the USMNT with Bob Ley & Alexi Lalas. Where the American Outlaws built their support during the World Cup in 2014, and during every qualifier/Gold Cup/Copa America Centenario. Where we celebrated after the Snow Classico, because yes, we really were at that game (in a gorilla suit no less) üî¥üîµüî¥üîµ
Most importantly, it‚Äôs where I fell in love with Crystal Palace and forged friendships that will last a lifetime. Those Sat/Sun mornings (even at 5am) with @coloradopalace are a highlight of my week, where I get to hang out with great friends and suffer the heartache/joy (much more of the first) of supporting our weird underdog working class South London team. I love our odd collection of expats/randos who all felt the same passion that drew us to Palace. I know we will find a new home and make it our own. But I will desperately miss what we had here. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
The relationships and friends and bonds we‚Äôve made will survive. I am heartbroken for the staff who got up at insane early hours or worked super late so that we could drink and laugh and hang out in a place with like minded fans. You guys worked hard, and sometimes got overwhelmed, but your efforts were noticed and appreciated. To John Forget, who‚Äôs vision of a central soccer pub for all of Denver became reality, thank you for dreaming it and building it and bringing us all together. I wouldn‚Äôt have the life or friends I have without the Three Lions. I will miss it immensely. üíî‚öΩÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüî¥üîµ",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

I think we make things happen, whether consciously or unconsciously. Every time I visit the South, I get a little nostalgic, maybe even homesick. About a year ago that led me to a wonderful website (and now podcast) called @bittersoutherner. I‚Äôve been supporting and reading it ever since. I even joined their member‚Äôs only Facebook group, which is where I learned about President Carter‚Äôs Sunday School.
üá∫üá∏
Fast forward to this weekend. I‚Äôm on my way back home to take care of my mom and while planning this idea just popped up: what if I could grab a car and drive down to Plains, GA for the service?
üá∫üá∏
Now I‚Äôm no Christian. In fact this might be my first ever visit to Sunday School. But I really needed the reminder that good people have been President. And continue to do good. And there are good Christians too. Too often, growing up in the South, I focused on how people used religion for their own selfish purposes. Or as a reason to hate. I still have plenty of issues with organized religion. But the ideas, man, the ideas are good!
üá∫üá∏
Would that everyone could hear Jimmy Carter speak about these ideals. Would that everyone could follow his example in the way he has led his life. He asked us today if we would make America better, just by helping a neighbor, or a friend, or a family member, and I hope we can rise to his challenge, now more than ever. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

None of this should work. Many might say it barely does. But day after day of riding the trains and the underground and seeing people go about their day proves otherwise. Somehow, through centuries and logistics and technology and good will, it just does.

I think we sometimes forget that. Our society incentivizes us to judge constantly, to always see the negative, to tear down anyone or anything that dares to rise above the fray.

But it‚Äôs still our choice to participate. To comment or tweet or be rude to someone just because we can. It‚Äôs so easy to resort to ugliness.

This Fall has been the worst weather I think I‚Äôve ever experienced in Colorado. Snowstorms came early and haven‚Äôt stopped coming. The last one was the biggest in 25 years. Tonight it snowed yet again. Not for long, but long enough to really drive home how shitty it‚Äôs been.

We haven‚Äôt even hit December and it already feels like we‚Äôve had more snow than entire years previous to this. It‚Äôs disheartening. It‚Äôs hard to get around the city. It‚Äôs hard to even want to leave the warmth of home.

Tonight I was determined to go out anyway. To see good friends and to imbibe good drinks and to have good conversations that probably won‚Äôt change the world but at least might make both participants think just a little bit deeper than before.

Sure we commiserated about the weather. Hard not to. It‚Äôs easy to complain. But on the way home I chose to walk a few extra blocks out of my way to the park nearby to take this picture.

With the snow covered field in the foreground and the skyline of the city I love standing against the horizon, it was easy to stop, in the cold, with wet snow creeping into my shoes, and choose to see the beauty of this moment on a cold, snowy night. Just the beauty of the snow and the lights of the city against the dark sky.

These moments are always there, all around us. We just have to stop and choose to see them. To choose them over the ugliness.

21832,"It has been a decade. If you are reading this, we‚Äôve survived. That‚Äôs something. Some of my friends haven‚Äôt.

When I look back it‚Äôs a bit daunting to consider how much has changed. The whole decade feels like two halves.

At the end of 2009, I had finally managed to move to Denver. But it was on the back of a pretty major failure at a job/career I thought I‚Äôd be really good at. I‚Äôd also just taken my mom on an amazing trip of a lifetime to Vienna, but even that was bittersweet as it was also the beginning of the end of the relationship that had brought me back there.

In the early part of this decade, I had to start over from scratch. And that‚Äôs what I did. I struggled but found work. I went out and made new lifelong friends. I even fell into new relationships, which, while they didn‚Äôt last, taught me the importance of communication, listening, how to have your heart broken, and more importantly how to mend it and how to be comfortable being alone.

The first half of the decade I was filled with hope for the future of the world and our country, but pretty down on my own life and future.

Everything flipped in the latter half. While I‚Äôm increasingly pessimistic about the world and the rise of everything awful in the last four years, I‚Äôve been much luckier in my personal life. I‚Äôve grown as a person. I‚Äôve traveled to places I‚Äôd only dreamed of. I made new lifelong friends. I found communities of creative, like-minded people that I can‚Äôt wait to engage with more in the new decade.

I‚Äôve never been more excited or terrified of what comes next. I have a (rough) plan. Execution will be in the details. I‚Äôve become more flexible, more calm, more focused, and sometimes I almost feel ready for the challenges ahead.

The increasingly Jenga-like structures, built higher and higher with little regard to stability, dietary needs, or traditional norms, were lauded for their creativity and brazenness.

But underneath, were they a cry for help? Was the foundation of these triumphant tributes to mornings at the pub (watching soccer with friends while nursing the ultimate hangover cure drink) rotten to the core?

21856,"This weekend was the first time I really pined for a return to normalcy. I have been very fortunate in that my life and job at home had to change very little to support our new reality. But while the logistics have been easy, the emotional side has not been.

Since before this quarantine started, I have been worried about pretty much only one thing: my mom, who is in the high risk category for the virus; isolated at home in TN.

Sometime earlier this week my mom fell. This is a regular occurrence. Only this time she was unable to get back up. Normally, Meals on Wheels would stop by and she would receive help. But they only come once a week now, on Fridays.

It took me two days to realize something was wrong after multiple unanswered messages. We called in a wellness check and the police found her on the floor near the front door.

She‚Äôs in the hospital now and seemingly ok. But she‚Äôs going to be there for at least a week. And after that she has to go to a long term care facility for rehab.

This means that the nightmare I‚Äôve been having from the start of all this has suddenly become significantly more likely. The two places I wanted to make sure she avoided are now the two places she has to be to recover from her fall. The virus has been spreading mercilessly through nursing homes and other facilities. If my mom catches it there is very little chance of her surviving.

I am scared.

I really, really hope I get to see my mom again. I hate that I can‚Äôt go visit, can‚Äôt support her, basically have to just sit here and worry (which I know doesn‚Äôt help). On Friday, I went down to Castlewood Canyon State Park. I needed not just to go somewhere new and be in nature but I needed someplace calming and serene to help cope with all the uncertainty. Hanging out with 55 million year old rocks helped for a bit.

Time seems to be passing really damn slowly right now. I know all of us are going through a lot. The daily onslaught of news and the amount of uncertainty about the future can be completely overwhelming.

That morning I got off to a slow start. And pretty early on I just became overwhelmed with sadness. Not over anything in particular. Maybe over everything. My mom. This pandemic. The way people treat each other. The horribleness and brutality that continues to be inflicted on black and marginalized people. The lack of social connection. The selfishness, privilege, entitlement, and greed seemingly always on display. The sheer stupidity of our ‚Äúleaders‚Äù. It was a lot. And it was clear I was going to have to sit with that sadness for a bit. But that didn‚Äôt mean I had to stay home.

I made my way out to the park with no real plan. Just some water and a snack. A cursory glance at the map at the trailhead was enough to set off. The falls seemed like a reachable destination and turnaround point.

Staunton is a beautiful place. Easy to hike and with lots of gentle elevation change for a decent workout. I made it to the falls in about two hours and hung out there for a bit watching climbers rappel down the rock-face.

By 5:15pm, I decided I could push on to the overlook, which put me high above the falls for a completely different perspective. From there I discovered a shortcut back to the pond.

My final good decision was refusing to take the same trail back to the parking lot, instead veering off on a longer trail that looped up to another dazzling view and then past an old mill. Friends I had over an hour on that trail of complete solitude and it was joyous. Not another living soul nearby. Hard to explain how much I needed that given our solitary current lifestyle. But for an hour I didn‚Äôt have to think about anyone not wearing a mask or being an asshole or anything as no one passed me on the trail.

By 7:20pm I had made it to the mill and challenged the sun to a race to see who would arrive first: me back at the parking lot or the sun at it‚Äôs destination on the horizon (the sun won, but it was close). The last gift nature had to give me was a fox that loped straight across my path at the parking lot, seeking out a dinner of scraps beneath the picnic tables.

And I realized I was no longer sad.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

21861,"This is the new normal. This is what a pandemic Saturday in Denver looks like.
First full day of riding the new bike around town. Curbside pickup of some records and lunch. Quick tune in for the rocket launch. Sneak peak at an artist collective space and a backyard concert. Socially distant flight of beer. A second backyard show. Not pictured, but ended by picking up some take home craft cocktails and stopping by the pub for one socially distant beer with some friends/regulars before curfew. Not too shabby.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
21862,"I made this 6 years ago.
It was an extra lockup I had a bit of time to make in a letterpress workshop I was taking over a weekend, taught by @rickgriffith

At the time the Ferguson protests were still raging and I was heartbroken seeing St. Louis, a city I had called home for 5 years, devolve into chaos. I was heartbroken over Michael Brown, a black man I did not know, losing his life unnecessarily. I was heartbroken at the comments and media coverage all bent on justifying a murder.

I spent every night following the coverage on social media. Arguing with people who didn‚Äôt understand. Trying to get through to friends who weren‚Äôt ready to. Trying to find my voice and my place to speak out, while also reconciling my privilege and status in this corrupt system we‚Äôve built.

I learned. I listened. I expanded my exposure to black and marginalized voices and I sat with the pain and suffering they voiced. I empathized as much as I could.

I took action too. I joined the marches and protests here. I took the print above and fashioned it into a protest sign. I lay on the street and played dead to block traffic.

And in the end, nothing changed. Here we are, 6 years later and if anything it‚Äôs gotten worse. Some days I fear the only option is to run, an immense privilege.

But I also see so much good being shared now. Mutual aid groups. Organizing. Outspoken activists. And, best of all, this shared sense that this time, maybe everyone I know gets it. I‚Äôm not arguing with friends now. The people I know are using their voices, sharing resources, boosting marginalized voices, trying to help however they can. We are not perfect and we all still have to reckon with our privilege and comfort and the gravitational pull of that. It‚Äôs so much easier to sit behind a screen and be safe. Especially during a pandemic.

I hope we all challenge ourselves to do more. To be willing to hit the streets. To risk the tear gas and rubber bullets. Because the thing about equality is it really does affect all of us. We‚Äôre all being held back by these backwards views. We can‚Äôt play it safe anymore. Our whole country is at risk. Let‚Äôs not choose the warmth of the fire as it burns down around us.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

1986. We would drive down the mountain (usually in my mom's beige Volvo station wagon) to this Pizza Hut for family dinners. Back when you ate their pizzas with a knife and fork, like a gentleman, with a white tablecloth underneath.
To the left of the entrance they had a stand up arcade version of Super Mario Bros. I quickly became obsessed. I played it every time we went. I dreamt about it. The music haunted me.
Despite my obsession, when pressed, I asked for an Atari 7800 for my birthday? Xmas? Not sure that year.

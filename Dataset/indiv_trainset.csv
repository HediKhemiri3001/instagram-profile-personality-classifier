5957,today was a day where the clay made me work for it some days youre just off and thats okay i havent thrown since early december and theres been a lot of loss and stress in our lives since then today was my day to finally scratch an itch to get back on the wheel to feel like me again a less empty me these stupid pots should never have been i should have quit not long after wrestling to center the first ball i tell my students if you arent centered then your clay wont be potting is as much a state of mind as it is technical skill my mind wasnt here yet each one of these pots shows an imperfection that flowed out from my center today and maybe thats exactly what i needed the crud had to come out and as it did i wrestled it and cursed it and lo and behold something was formed from all of that i guess sometimes we do need a good fight with ourselves throwingmylifeaway,1,1,0,0
5958,im likely ahead of myself here but i dont care i want to go to this workshop i want to work my butt off for two weeks and learn as much as i can about wood firing and by doing anyone care to throw me 1500 plus airfare in exchange for some pottery and eternal gratitude repost with so the workshop i am teaching filled on the first day but i am teaching a very different one at my pottery in wisconsin this summer and i just opened registration today limited to 7 participants 6 places left june 30july 13 this is one of my favorite images from the workshop i taught at my pottery in gresham last summer the workshop is called the intimate anagama in the image sits alone with the hot kiln pouring over the kiln log his intensity is matched by the fire beside him his involvement is complete and we see him in this intimate moment the workshop is designed to create this kind of intense learning experience there is community work there is alone time there is equal part in decision making there are demos a guest artist community meals and you leave with 12 cubic feet of your own work fired by you if you are trying to get a grasp of wood firing this workshop is for you see more details on my website in my profile or message me and will be assisting,1,1,0,0

6030,another piece from a recent rakufiring coincidentally enough i didnt use raku clay which i understand can be risky because the that clay body is better suited to handle the thermal shock of plucking the pot out of an 1800 degree fire and throwing it a bucket of combustible material for 10 minutes and then submerging it in cold water to immediately cool it off a harsh process not made for the faint clay bodies this was highwater clays littleloafers a throw away demo pot to show my students how to use a hump mold it is covered with one glaze color red luster the areas that are green are where it has been oxidized and the shiny coppery red areas on the bottom are evidence of reduction in those spots i have a little bit of carbon to scrub off it still but even so its a super lustrous piece and no longer a throw away pot,1,1,0,0

6365,the lovely daughter got a smaller bike for her birthday two years ago but never showed much interest in riding a bike until this summer as kids do she grew substantially in the intervening two years and honestly needed a new bike that said we parents would not be duped into buying another bike only to have her not ride it so we told her she might wink wink get a new bike for her birthday if she learned to ride the smaller bike well ladies and gentlemen she worked and worked and learned to ride that tiny bike and on her birthday she received a new bike and loves it especially the fact that it has pegs because shes a huge napoleon dynamite fan the moral of the story is that parents still have power kids do enjoy things other than staring at a smartphone screen and one day if she works real hard she might just take her new bike off some sweet jumps,1,1,0,1

10624,week 3 of single monitor life and im starting to feel the short comings the second week i was working on some hardware configurations and the parts were a bit awkward to work with so having the extra desk space was brilliant doing some more traditional development and research that second monitor was sorely missed im feeling going back to using a second display thats 1080 will be a step backwards whilst the point of a single monitor is focus sometimes what you need to focus on requires a lot of space so even that secondary focus to have it in view fully would benefit from a bigger display ive got a week and a bit of work left this year so still time to refine this setup before making the choice of to stick to single life or double up or triple up desk desksetup deskspace setupinspiration ikeadesk workstation officeinspiration homeoffice minimal minimalsetups isetups devlife productivity react reactdev electron javascript lgmonitor lg lg27uk600,1,0,0,1

10746,that time of the week where i pick a dram and tell you what i think and probably do an awful job explaining flavours its whisky wednesday todays dram from is a deanston 14yearold organic single malt 463 abv not knowingly tried an organic so thats something different here but its a highland whisky which is normally an easy drinker nothing offensive but enough to let you know youre drinking a whisky on the nose with this one it took me a while but it initially had a somewhat earthy aroma but didnt seem right a few more sniffs it struck me as a mix of fresh cooking apples and sweet malt the taste clears it brings out that sweet baking flavours of pears and muscovado a very warming sensation i often say that this sort fo profile in a whisky is after dinner one a desert whisky but that doesnt fit here an autumn whisky for sure with the finish having a medium length spice to it i think this is one for a fireworks night or halloween a whisky to watch the leaves change colour a nice understated whisky that wouldnt go amiss in a collection if youre reading this far down may i suggest you follow were doing monthly tastings via zoom and this week were sampling so something a little different follow or join and see about coming song to one of our friendly sessions whiskywednesday drinkstagram drinksbythedram deanston highlandsinglemalt highlandsinglemaltscotchwhisky scotch scotchwhisky singlemalt organic dram dramstagram autumnvibes autumnwhisky whiskylover whiskygram whiskyclub whiskytasting whiskysample,1,0,0,1

10751,its wednesday and i have a whisky as is the tradition i shall obnoxiously taste it and provide my level headed feedback that is more akin to somebody who is drunk and is trying to sound like they know what the hell they are talking about today is a dram of bunnahabhain 12yearold single malt 463 abv from they sent out their bimonthly bottle this week which is rather nice i must say and provided this sample with it ive tried a few rarer bunnahabhains plus their stiireadair which ive posted about previously and their range is quite complex whilst not massively into their stiireadair ive heard great things about this whisky normally with a whisky from islay you are expecting peat but doesnt typically follow suit which is no different here the nose immediately brings up spiced sundried fruits with a sweeter floral sense towards the end there reminds me of a strong alcohol wine at the end the taste is rich with nuts and fruit trail mix wise with that almonds apple cashews and citrus peel with a little toffee in there somewhere that finish is quick but fragrant with a little dryness to it almost coats the mouth no peat in this for me or even smoke so if you arent into that then you are very safe with this bottle i can see why summerton sent this sample with their main bottle i like it ive been looking at buying this for a while now but wasnt sure and ended up getting something else but i think ill need to have one of these in as a keeper its got a lot going for it at a reasonable price tag around 40 for a 70cl well worth a try whiskywednesday islay islaywhisky singlemalt singlemaltwhisky singlemaltscotch singlemaltscotchwhisky bunnahabhain bunnahabhainwhisky bunnahabhain12 scotch whiskylover whiskygram whiskytasting whiskyporn whiskey whiskeygram whiskeylover summertonwhiskyshots,1,0,0,1

10851,this is a typical saturday night drink for me a glass of whiskey not normally this much but im getting rid of a bottle any way i like a drink and this is fine for my diabetes the main thing i need to be aware of is alcohol can lower blood sugars this can be a bit of a concern when going out for a session as i need to weigh up the sugar content of a drink against the alcohol what works for me is high alcohol as most of the sugar is gone so all i need to is top up on carbs what has happened due to this also is my tolerance is rather high so if im acting a bit drunk the more logical issue is im low its a way of enjoying yourself and feeling the nicer affects of alcohol without the worries of high blood sugars or confusion of drunk or low im not a fan of getting drunk either way i drink for flavour hence my enjoyment of rather expensive whiskies type1 type1diabetic type1diabetes t1d diabetic diabetes bluenovember diabetesawareness diabetesawarenessmonth bluenovember alcohol whiskey whisky whiskygeek,1,0,0,1

10853,over the last few days my blood sugars have been a bit haywire can be a struggle to get it right either too high or too low you want to be fully compos mentis but at the same time you want to comfortable unfortunately its easier to stay high as a safety net type1 type1diabetic type1diabetes t1d diabetic diabetes bluenovember diabetesawareness diabetesawarenessmonth bluenovember,1,0,0,1
10854,back to work today after a very emotional few days and my blood sugars has been awful drinking coffee doesnt help my sugars are dipping and spiking looking like a diagram for a load of black runs taking in carbs seem like theyre doing what it should then i get jittery till i crash luckily working from home i can get my self to a point where i can focus and carry on working with perseverance i managed to get my tasks done for the day its a mix of patience i enjoy what i do for a living and not letting the diabetes get the better of me type1 type1diabetic type1diabetes t1d diabetic diabetes bluenovember diabetesawareness diabetesawarenessmonth bluenovember,1,0,0,1
10855,the ongoing fun of unruly blood sugars continues my go to pick up is jelly babies four of these and my sugars are back to normal then i all need is something fibrous to keep the levels up i over a longer period interestingly it needs to be done in order high sugar first then fibre otherwise the fibre blocks the sugar till its processed which can take a while also this was a bloody difficult photo to take as my hands were shaking so much type1 type1diabetic type1diabetes t1d diabetic diabetes bluenovember diabetesawareness diabetesawarenessmonth bluenovember,1,0,0,1
10856,one of the biggest issues i have with diabetes is not the blood tests or injections or the really crap feelings i have nope its the fact that im limited in what i can drink the amount of soft drinks with sugarscarbs in them is the worst even if they say sugar free or zero sugar they could have carbs more often than not nowadays you may see me drink mainly pepsi max as thats what i know is safe and the only thing that tastes good for me fruit juices flavoured waters and also health drinks are shockingly bad for me weirdly this is mainly an issue in the uk in places like ireland and canada i can often pick a whole range of drinks to have with a true 00 carb content seems like a minor thing and it is but when your out and want a quick drink of something other than water youre massively limited if the uk truly wants to stop kids drinking sugary drinks then maybe do more to incentivise getting true sugar free drinks in the market last thing a lot of what you read about artificial sweeteners is bull type1 type1diabetic type1diabetes t1d diabetic diabetes bluenovember diabetesawareness diabetesawarenessmonth bluenovember,1,0,0,1

10859,i love lazing at home playing video games im somewhat healthy i try and go to the gym when i can and i eat fairly healthy not diet healthy which 90 of it is bull some may see my video game lifestyle as s possible reason why im diabetic many people think diabetes is directly related to being overweight this is not true for type 1 or type 2 closest thing true to that is being overweight may increase likelihood of type 2 diabetes but its not a deciding factor in fact most people with type 2 arent overweight and most overweight dont develop it i think thats source from diabetes uk but i can fact check if anybody queries that with regards to my diabetes type 1 its most likely caused by genetics and unknown factors anybody can develop it at any time but type 1 is most likely to occur at development stages in life so if somebody has diabetes youll be mostly wrong to assume its their lifestyle actually i found out recently theres a whole host of body building groups that are made up of type 1 and 2 diabetics so healthy people can be diabetic type1 type1diabetic type1diabetes t1d diabetic diabetes bluenovember diabetesawareness diabetesawarenessmonth bluenovember,1,0,0,1

12537,several months ago at the start of the pandemic i bought a turntable figuring vinyl would be a good habit to get into while stuck at home of course once it was delivered i needed a place to put it so i started shopping for standsconsolesvinyl storage inspired by and dumpster find turned record console quarantine project i went on the hunt on craigslist and found this art deco nightstand that looked to be the right size and fit a lucky break it took a while to assemble the necessary tools stain supplies etc and to research how to strip the paint and refinish it since id never done that before the end result is honestly better than i was ever hoping for i eyeballed the space where the two bottom drawers were when i bought the thing and wasnt actually sure vinyl would fit but it does perfectly sawed right through the crossbar and made a perfect cube my dad was always a handy person who did most house projects himself as an architect he designed and built the second story addition of the house i grew up in id scare my mom by climbing the scaffolding and hanging out on the roof with him while he worked he never let me get near the circular saw but i was always allowed to help mix concrete i havent often had much reason or need to do that type of stuff on my own as an adult but it feels really good to take an idea visualize the result gather the necessary tools and knowledge and execute the vision into something youre proud of highly recommended its made for a very fun weekend project and a nice addition to the room now i just need my backordered speakers to arriveupdate found the speakers on sale for a similar price at another retailer arriving friday yay swipe right for progress shots vinyl turntable artdeco quarantineproject,1,0,0,1

12541,12 or so years ago a young friendly and slightly obnoxious grey and white tuxedo cat showed up on our porch in tn not long after i had come home from a failed attempt at living and working overseas he had a pink collar and was very affectionate and happy and most importantly night after night he just stayed on the porch he would curl up on this rocking chair no bigger than the gourd sitting there now he caused a ruckus too by killing and gutting a couple of mourning doves much to my moms horror but then weve always had cats so having kills brought to us has never been surprising except the live snakes whoo boy since he wouldnt leave we began to feed him my mom had already taken in two stray cats but eventually she said we could bring him in and she would pay to take him to the vet and get checked out we did our due diligence and called shelters and checked if he was chipped but it was the start of the recession and lots of animals were abandoned his previous owners were gone and so he came into the house made friends with the other two cats and was given the name brutus because he brute forced his way into our home i was still dealing with the loss of a previous cat who died under the worst circumstances falling out a window in vienna and suffering for a week as vets tried their best to save him but it was clear that brutus was not going to take no for an answer and my mom made it clear that when i moved back to colorado he would have to go with me and so he did i was really worried about moving him back with me to tn i bought a fancy carrier and a thundershirt and calming spray the first part of the trip was pretty rough but we made it and in the end i realized that home for him wasnt the apartment we shared in denver home has always been wherever i am he is the most affectionate cat i have ever owned hes my buddy my best friend and i desperately wish he could live forever at least right now we are here and working through this rough patch together this is for both of us our ancestral home where it all began and where the next phase begins love you brutus,1,0,0,1

12866,this weekend was the first time i really pined for a return to normalcy i have been very fortunate in that my life and job at home had to change very little to support our new reality but while the logistics have been easy the emotional side has not been since before this quarantine started i have been worried about pretty much only one thing my mom who is in the high risk category for the virus isolated at home in tn sometime earlier this week my mom fell this is a regular occurrence only this time she was unable to get back up normally meals on wheels would stop by and she would receive help but they only come once a week now on fridays it took me two days to realize something was wrong after multiple unanswered messages we called in a wellness check and the police found her on the floor near the front door shes in the hospital now and seemingly ok but shes going to be there for at least a week and after that she has to go to a long term care facility for rehab this means that the nightmare ive been having from the start of all this has suddenly become significantly more likely the two places i wanted to make sure she avoided are now the two places she has to be to recover from her fall the virus has been spreading mercilessly through nursing homes and other facilities if my mom catches it there is very little chance of her surviving i am scared i really really hope i get to see my mom again i hate that i cant go visit cant support her basically have to just sit here and worry which i know doesnt help on friday i went down to castlewood canyon state park i needed not just to go somewhere new and be in nature but i needed someplace calming and serene to help cope with all the uncertainty hanging out with 55 million year old rocks helped for a bit time seems to be passing really damn slowly right now i know all of us are going through a lot the daily onslaught of news and the amount of uncertainty about the future can be completely overwhelming im sharing what im going through because i think its important to share and ask for help when you need it no one should have to go through any of this alone,1,0,0,1

12869,tbt to this monday when i spent 8 wonderful hours at this park that morning i got off to a slow start and pretty early on i just became overwhelmed with sadness not over anything in particular maybe over everything my mom this pandemic the way people treat each other the horribleness and brutality that continues to be inflicted on black and marginalized people the lack of social connection the selfishness privilege entitlement and greed seemingly always on display the sheer stupidity of our leaders it was a lot and it was clear i was going to have to sit with that sadness for a bit but that didnt mean i had to stay home i made my way out to the park with no real plan just some water and a snack a cursory glance at the map at the trailhead was enough to set off the falls seemed like a reachable destination and turnaround point staunton is a beautiful place easy to hike and with lots of gentle elevation change for a decent workout i made it to the falls in about two hours and hung out there for a bit watching climbers rappel down the rockface by 515pm i decided i could push on to the overlook which put me high above the falls for a completely different perspective from there i discovered a shortcut back to the pond my final good decision was refusing to take the same trail back to the parking lot instead veering off on a longer trail that looped up to another dazzling view and then past an old mill friends i had over an hour on that trail of complete solitude and it was joyous not another living soul nearby hard to explain how much i needed that given our solitary current lifestyle but for an hour i didnt have to think about anyone not wearing a mask or being an asshole or anything as no one passed me on the trail by 720pm i had made it to the mill and challenged the sun to a race to see who would arrive first me back at the parking lot or the sun at its destination on the horizon the sun won but it was close the last gift nature had to give me was a fox that loped straight across my path at the parking lot seeking out a dinner of scraps beneath the picnic tables and i realized i was no longer sad,1,0,0,1

12872,i made this 6 years ago it was an extra lockup i had a bit of time to make in a letterpress workshop i was taking over a weekend taught by at the time the ferguson protests were still raging and i was heartbroken seeing st louis a city i had called home for 5 years devolve into chaos i was heartbroken over michael brown a black man i did not know losing his life unnecessarily i was heartbroken at the comments and media coverage all bent on justifying a murder i spent every night following the coverage on social media arguing with people who didnt understand trying to get through to friends who werent ready to trying to find my voice and my place to speak out while also reconciling my privilege and status in this corrupt system weve built i learned i listened i expanded my exposure to black and marginalized voices and i sat with the pain and suffering they voiced i empathized as much as i could i took action too i joined the marches and protests here i took the print above and fashioned it into a protest sign i lay on the street and played dead to block traffic and in the end nothing changed here we are 6 years later and if anything its gotten worse some days i fear the only option is to run an immense privilege but i also see so much good being shared now mutual aid groups organizing outspoken activists and best of all this shared sense that this time maybe everyone i know gets it im not arguing with friends now the people i know are using their voices sharing resources boosting marginalized voices trying to help however they can we are not perfect and we all still have to reckon with our privilege and comfort and the gravitational pull of that its so much easier to sit behind a screen and be safe especially during a pandemic i hope we all challenge ourselves to do more to be willing to hit the streets to risk the tear gas and rubber bullets because the thing about equality is it really does affect all of us were all being held back by these backwards views we cant play it safe anymore our whole country is at risk lets not choose the warmth of the fire as it burns down around us,1,0,0,1

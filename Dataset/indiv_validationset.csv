1259,today something different from the usual format thats what i love of london the mix of old architecture steps away from modern buildings the city of london is full sights and corners like this one in st helens square the st andrew undershaft church is one of the few rare churches built around the 15th century which has survived both the great fire of london in the 17th century and the blitz bombing during the second world war the church has been partially restored after the iras bombings in the 90s in the background the skyscraper named the scalpel and a reflection of the 30 st mary axe commonly known as the gherkin tower because apparently londoners like to nickname buildings by their look and shape and now hashtags london uk cityoflondon architecture archilovers history architectureuk picturetokeeparchitecture cornerlookup fineartarchitecture lookinguparchitecture architecturephotography srsbuildingsexcellentstructure fromwherewearcharchitectureview curatedarchiarchifeatures,1,1,0,0

2602,isolation project self portrait for our second isolation project we were tasked with taking a self portrait in the portrait we should include something that has been with us in isolation or that represents our isolation i chose emotion our emotions are always with us and ive taken the time during isolation to try and really understand my emotional state and acknowledge it what you see is a story starting with silliness flowing to boredom depression and anger then follows acceptance and a will to take charge of an emotional state which then evolves to seeking support from those around you leading to light and happiness ive included the before images and the final edited images to make the edits i used affinity photo for ipad in the images i used a darker colour palate for the negative emotions which get gradually darker and grainier as they progress as the emotional state moves into a more positive mental state the images get lighter brighter and the light becomes more intense all photos where taken using an iphone 11 pro max using the wide lens the iphone was on a tripod using a remote shutter and the light is provided by a large window for ambient light and an additional adjustable key light for the record i think its important to not think of less desired emotions as negative while they can feel that way at the time its important to see that without them we would never feel happiness we all have dark times its good to acknowledge and accept them and to deal with them mcrisoproject,1,1,0,1
